**Impact:** Focus on live coding demonstrations and practical problem-solving

### **3. Comprehensive Student Assessment (Q&A #9-10)**
**Decision:** 6-category technical background survey before first class
**Rationale:** Enable course customization based on student capabilities
**Impact:** Targeted support and balanced team formation possible

### **4. Historical Context Integration (Q&A #12)**
**Decision:** Include emotional journey arc from AI winters to current revolution
**Rationale:** Student motivation through understanding field evolution
**Impact:** 70+ year timeline connects to course modules and career perspective

### **5. Template-Driven Consistency (Q&A #6)**
**Decision:** Standardized formats for all planning documents
**Rationale:** Easy replication and collaborative development
**Impact:** 15-week course structure with consistent 1-hour planning files

## üìã Action Items Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Today
- [x] Repository analysis and CLAUDE.md creation
- [x] Chat history system activation and documentation
- [x] Complete course planning directory structure
- [x] Missing content files (monthly plans, assessment schedules)
- [x] Week 1 Hour 1 comprehensive class material
- [x] Student background assessment questionnaire
- [x] Deep learning explanation and history documents

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] End-of-day ceremony completion (currently executing)

### ‚è≥ Next Session Priorities
- [ ] Create Google Colab notebook for Hour 1 live coding demonstrations
- [ ] Develop remaining Week 1 materials (Lecture 2, Tutorial 1)
- [ ] Send student questionnaire before first class
- [ ] Review and test online delivery platform setup

## üéØ Tomorrow's Context Brief

### **Where We Left Off:**
Successfully completed major infrastructure setup with comprehensive Week 1 Hour 1 material creation. Repository is fully structured with course planning hierarchy, assessment schedules, and student evaluation tools in place.

### **Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **Repository Foundation**: CLAUDE.md, chat history system, complete directory structure
- ‚úÖ **Course Infrastructure**: Monthly plans, assessment schedules, templates
- ‚úÖ **Week 1 Foundation**: Hour 1 class material, student questionnaire, content explanations
- üîÑ **Implementation Ready**: Materials prepared for live coding demonstrations

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Google Colab Development**: Create interactive notebook for XOR problem and TensorFlow foundations
2. **Week 1 Completion**: Develop Lecture 2 (biological neurons) and Tutorial 1 (TensorFlow setup)
3. **Student Communication**: Finalize and send background questionnaire
4. **Platform Testing**: Verify online delivery setup and screen sharing optimization

### **Key Context for Tomorrow:**
- **Focus Area**: Week 1 practical implementation materials
- **Technical Priority**: Google Colab notebook development for live demonstrations
- **Academic Context**: First online class may occur this week - materials must be classroom-ready
- **Student Needs**: Background assessment required before first delivery

### **Energy Assessment**: High momentum day with complete infrastructure success - excellent foundation for continued development
