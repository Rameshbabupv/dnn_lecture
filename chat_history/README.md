## Daily Workflow

### Morning Startup (5 minutes)
1. **Load Context**: Read previous day's summary from `daily_summaries/[PREVIOUS-DATE]-summary.md`
2. **Review Status**: Check pending action items and open questions
3. **Context Brief**: Get AI briefing with momentum from yesterday
4. **Session Setup**: Create/continue today's daily chat file: `sessions/[TODAY]-daily-chat.md`
5. **Ready State**: Begin with clear priorities and suggested next steps

### During Sessions (Continuous)
1. **Real-time Capture**: Document EVERY significant Q&A exchange immediately
2. **Reverse Order**: Add newest entries at TOP of daily file (push older content down)
3. **Sequential Numbering**: Continue Q&A numbering across conversations (never reset)
4. **Live Updates**: Update daily chat file throughout all conversations (never batch)
5. **File Splitting**: When file reaches **20+ Q&As** OR **~1500 lines** OR **>500KB**:
   - Archive current as `-part-1.md`
   - Create `-part-2.md` as active continuation
   - Include questions-only summary at top of new part
6. **Tag Everything**: Use `#<tag_name>` for searchability
7. **Track Decisions**: Record rationale and impact for all choices

### End of Day (5-10 minutes)
1. **Session Summary**: Complete summary within daily chat file
2. **Daily Summary**: Create/update `daily_summaries/[TODAY]-summary.md`
3. **Tomorrow's Brief**: Prepare specific starting context and first question
4. **Quality Check**: Run `templates/end-of-day-ceremony.md` checklist
5. **Clean Closure**: Ensure zero context loss for next session

## Templates Available

### Core Templates (MANDATORY)
- `qa-entry-template.md` - Standard Q&A format for individual exchanges
- `session-template.md` - Daily chat file structure (single file per day)
- `daily-summary-template.md` - End-of-day recap format with action items
- `morning-startup-routine.md` - Daily continuation process guide
- `end-of-day-ceremony.md` - Session closure checklist (NEW)

### Documentation Templates
- `concept-template.md` - Key concept documentation format

### Usage Priority
1. **Daily Operations**: qa-entry → session → morning-startup → end-of-day-ceremony
2. **Weekly Review**: daily-summary analysis and concept documentation
3. **Quality Control**: Regular template compliance verification

## File Management Rules

### Single Daily File Approach (Credit Optimization)
- **Format**: `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-chat.md` (all conversations for the day)
- **Benefits**: Fewer file operations, easier daily review, better credit management
- **Structure**: Multiple sessions within single daily file

### File Splitting Guidelines
**When to Split**: File reaches ANY of these thresholds:
- **20+ Q&A entries** in single file
- **~1500 lines** of content
- **>500KB** file size

**How to Split**:
1. **Archive Current**: Rename to `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-chat-part-1.md`
2. **Create New**: Start `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-chat-part-2.md` as active
3. **Continuity Bridge**: Add questions-only summary from part-1 at top of part-2
4. **Sequential Numbers**: Continue Q&A numbering across parts (Q25→Q26→Q27)
5. **Reverse Order**: Within each part, newest entries stay at top

### Content Ordering Rules
- **Within Daily File**: Reverse chronological (newest Q&A entries first)
- **Across File Parts**: Logical continuation (part-1 → part-2 → part-3)
- **Q&A Display**: Latest first for immediate context (Q27→Q26→Q25)
- **Session Timestamps**: Eastern Time (ET) format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM ET`
