- **Technology Stack:** TensorFlow 2.x, Keras API, OpenCV, Google Colab
- **Assessment Structure:** 45% Unit Tests + 15% Lab + 40% Final Exam
- **Duration:** 15 weeks, 45 contact hours (2L + 1T + 0P format)

## Implementation Details
```
Module Progression:
Week 1-3:   Perceptron → MLP → TensorFlow basics → Activation functions
Week 4-6:   Gradient descent → Regularization → Normalization techniques

```

## Related Concepts
- **Comprehensive Chat History System** - Documentation workflow for course development
- **Progressive Learning Methodology** - Educational approach building complexity gradually
- **Theory-Practice Integration** - Balancing conceptual understanding with implementation skills

## Dependencies
**Prerequisites:**
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Linear algebra and calculus fundamentals
- Understanding of machine learning concepts

**Impacts:**
- Course materials must align with progressive difficulty
- Practical tasks require TensorFlow/Keras proficiency
- Assessment design must cover both theory and implementation

## Decision History
| Date | Decision | Reason | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2025-08-12 | Emphasize Google Colab platform | Accessibility for students without local setup | Uniform development environment |
| 2025-08-12 | 40-60% theory-practice split | Hands-on focus for better retention | Increased practical implementation time |

## Examples & Use Cases
### Example 1: Module 1 Implementation
**Situation:** Teaching basic neural networks to M.Tech students
**Implementation:** Start with biological neuron analogy, progress to perceptron logic gates, implement XOR with MLP
**Outcome:** Students understand fundamental concepts and can implement basic networks

### Example 2: Assessment Design
**Situation:** Creating Unit Test 1 covering Modules 1-2
**Implementation:** Include theoretical questions on activation functions and practical coding problems
**Outcome:** Balanced evaluation of conceptual understanding and implementation skills

## Best Practices
- Begin each module with conceptual overview before diving into implementation
- Use visual aids and diagrams for complex architectures
- Provide reference implementations for all 15 tutorial tasks
- Maintain progression from simple to complex across entire course
- Include industry-relevant examples and pre-trained models
- Design assessments that test both understanding and application

## Metrics & Success Criteria
**How to Measure Success:**
- **Learning Outcome Achievement**: Students meet CO-1 through CO-5 objectives
- **Practical Proficiency**: Successful completion of all 15 tutorial tasks
- **Assessment Performance**: Balanced scores across theory and practical components

**Warning Signs:**
- Students struggling with basic TensorFlow operations in later modules
- Large gaps between theoretical understanding and practical implementation
- Assessment results showing imbalanced theory vs practice performance

## Questions & Discussions
### Resolved Questions
- **Q:** Should course emphasize TensorFlow 1.x or 2.x?
- **A:** Focus on TensorFlow 2.x with Keras API for modern practices
- **Source:** Technology stack decision in course planning

### Open Questions
