## Previous Session: GitHub Classroom Setup

### Context
- **Course**: Deep Neural Network Architectures (21CSE558T)
- **Current Setup**: students_github repo for content distribution
- **Goal**: Implement GitHub Classroom for better student workflow management

### Decision Made
Chose **GitHub Classroom** over fork/PR model or shared repo approach for:
- Automatic individual repo creation per student
- Centralized submission tracking
- Built-in gradebook functionality
- Eliminates Git workflow complexity for students

### Todo List Status (Previous)
Current tasks planned:
1. Set up GitHub Classroom organization *(in_progress)*
2. Create classroom for Deep Neural Network course
3. Import students_github repo as template repository
4. Create first assignment in GitHub Classroom
5. Create student instructions document
6. Test the workflow with a sample assignment

### Repository State
- **Main Repo:** git@github.com:Rameshbabupv/dnn_lecture.git
- **Students Repo:** git@github.com:Rameshbabupv/students_github.git
- Ready to be used as template repository for classroom assignments
