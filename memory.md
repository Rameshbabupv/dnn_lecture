# Memory - GitHub Classroom Setup for Deep Neural Network Course

## Context
- **Course**: Deep Neural Network Architectures (21CSE558T)
- **Current Setup**: students_github repo for content distribution
- **Goal**: Implement GitHub Classroom for better student workflow management

## Decision Made
Chose **GitHub Classroom** over fork/PR model or shared repo approach for:
- Automatic individual repo creation per student
- Centralized submission tracking
- Built-in gradebook functionality
- Eliminates Git workflow complexity for students

## Todo List Status
Current tasks planned:
1. Set up GitHub Classroom organization *(in_progress)*
2. Create classroom for Deep Neural Network course
3. Import students_github repo as template repository
4. Create first assignment in GitHub Classroom
5. Create student instructions document
6. Test the workflow with a sample assignment

## Next Session Actions
- Resume GitHub Classroom setup from Step 1
- Complete organization creation at https://classroom.github.com
- Follow the comprehensive setup guide created

## Current Repository State
- Remote: `git@github.com:Rameshbabupv/students_github.git`
- Ready to be used as template repository for classroom assignments
- Contains course materials that will be distributed to students automatically

## Expected Outcome
Transform from manual repo management to automated classroom workflow where students get individual repos and instructor has centralized dashboard for all submissions.
