### Assessment 2: Implementation Debugging (10 minutes)
**Present buggy code and ask students to identify issues:**

```python
# BUGGY CODE - Find the errors!
def buggy_mini_batch_gd(X, y, batch_size=32, epochs=100, lr=0.5):
    w, b = 1.0, 1.0  # Error 1: Poor initialization
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Error 2: Not shuffling data
        for i in range(0, len(X), batch_size):
            X_batch = X[i:i+batch_size]
            y_batch = y[i:i+batch_size]
            
            predictions = w * X_batch + b
            
            # Error 3: Wrong gradient calculation
            dw = (predictions - y_batch).mean()
            db = (predictions - y_batch).mean()
            
            # Error 4: Learning rate too large
            w -= lr * dw
            b -= lr * db
    
    return w, b
```

**Expected Student Answers:**
1. **Poor initialization:** Should use small random values, not 1.0
2. **No data shuffling:** Should shuffle each epoch for better convergence
3. **Wrong gradient for dw:** Should multiply by X_batch: `dw = ((predictions - y_batch) * X_batch).mean()`
4. **Learning rate too large:** 0.5 is typically too large for mini-batch GD

---

### Assessment 3: Prediction Exercise (8 minutes)
**Before running code, ask students to predict outcomes:**

```python
# Given these three setups, predict which will converge fastest and most stably:

# Setup A: Batch GD
batch_gd(X, y, learning_rate=0.1, epochs=50)

# Setup B: SGD  
stochastic_gd(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=50)

# Setup C: Mini-batch GD
mini_batch_gd(X, y, batch_size=32, learning_rate=0.05, epochs=50)
```

**Prediction Questions:**
1. **Which will have the smoothest convergence curve?** *(Answer: A - Batch GD)*
2. **Which will make the most parameter updates?** *(Answer: B - SGD)*
3. **Which is most practical for real applications?** *(Answer: C - Mini-batch)*
4. **Which might find a better final solution?** *(Answer: B - SGD, due to noise helping escape local minima)*

        # 4. Memory usage (estimate)
        pass
    
    # TODO: Create comparison plots
    # TODO: Identify optimal batch size
    return results

# Expected observations:
# - batch_size=1 (SGD): Fast but noisy
# - batch_size=32-64: Good balance
# - batch_size=1000: Smooth but slower
```

**Assessment Questions:**
1. **Which batch size converged fastest?**

## üìä Exit Assessment

### Quick Exit Ticket (3 minutes)
**Students must answer before leaving:**

**1. Fill in the blank:**
"For a dataset with 1,000 examples and batch_size=50, mini-batch GD will perform _____ parameter updates per epoch."

**Answer:** 20 updates (1000/50 = 20 batches)

**2. Scenario question:**
"You're training on a dataset with 1 million examples on a machine with limited memory. Which GD variant would you choose and why?"

**Sample Answer:** "Stochastic GD or mini-batch GD with small batch size (16-32) because they use less memory per update compared to batch GD which would need to load all 1M examples."

**3. Troubleshooting:**
"Your loss curve shows wild oscillations. List two things you would try to fix this:"

**Sample Answers:** 
- Reduce learning rate
- Increase batch size
- Check for data preprocessing issues
- Try gradient clipping

## üîç Common Student Errors and Solutions

### Error 1: Incorrect Gradient Calculation for Mini-batch
**Student Code:**
```python
dw = (predictions - y_batch).mean()  # WRONG!
```
**Correction:**
```python
dw = ((predictions - y_batch) * X_batch).mean()  # CORRECT
```

### Error 2: Using Same Learning Rate for All Variants
**Issue:** Students use lr=0.1 for all methods
**Solution:** Explain that SGD typically needs smaller learning rate (0.01), mini-batch needs medium (0.05), batch can use larger (0.1)

### Error 3: Not Shuffling Data
**Issue:** Students process data in same order each epoch
**Solution:** Emphasize importance of `np.random.permutation()` each epoch

### Error 4: Batch Size Larger Than Dataset
**Issue:** Setting batch_size=1000 for dataset with 500 examples
**Solution:** Show that this automatically becomes batch GD, explain with `min(batch_size, dataset_size)`
