## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Student Coding Errors

**Error 1: Array Shape Issues**
```python
# Student code:
predictions = w * X + b  # Error if X is (1000, 1)

# Fix:
predictions = w * X.squeeze() + b  # or X.flatten()
```

**Error 2: Gradient Calculation Mistakes**
```python
# Wrong:
dw = (predictions - y).mean()

# Correct:
dw = ((predictions - y) * X).mean()
```

**Error 3: Learning Rate Too Large**
- **Symptom:** Loss explodes or oscillates wildly
- **Solution:** Reduce learning rate by 10x
- **Teaching moment:** Explain relationship between batch size and LR

### Technical Issues

**Jupyter Notebook Problems:**
- Kernel crashes ‚Üí Restart kernel, re-run cells

- **Use pre-written code** for demonstration instead of live coding
- **Extend into break time** with student permission

**Finishing Early:**
- **Add bonus exercises** (batch size experiments)
