| 1 | Which of the following is not a linearly separable function?<br>AND, Sigmoid, XOR, OR<br>**Ans: XOR** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1.6.1 |
| 2 | Which task suits unsupervised learning best?<br>Spam classification, Fraudulent transaction of credit cards, Image segmentation, Heart disease predictions<br>**Ans: Image segmentation** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1.6.1 |
| 3 | What happens if your learning rate is too high?<br><br>Instead of moving steadily toward the minimum of the loss function, the parameter updates "overshoot" it. This can cause the model to diverge, with the loss increasing rather than decreasing. | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2.6.2 |
| 4 | You have a single neuron with input vector X = [1, 2], weights W = [0.5, -1.0], and bias = 0.5. The activation function is sigmoid.<br><br>**Q1. What is the output of the neuron?**<br>Y = 0.5×1 + (-1.0)×2 + 0.5 = -1 → apply sigmoid | 5 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 2.6.2 |
| 5 | A self-driving car adjusting its steering through reward-based feedback loop is an example of _________ learning<br>**Ans: Reinforcement** | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1.6.1 |
