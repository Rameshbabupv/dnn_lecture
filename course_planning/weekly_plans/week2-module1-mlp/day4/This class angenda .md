# ðŸ“‹ **LAB SESSION AGENDA - Week 2, Day 4** 

## **Subject: Deep Neural Network Architectures (21CSE558T) - TensorFlow Fundamentals Lab

### ðŸ“‹ **Duration: 3-4 hours (6 exercises Ã— 30-45 mins each)**

#### **Class Information**

  **Objective** : This hands-on lab session introduces M.Tech students to TensorFlow fundamentals through progressive exercises building toward neural network implementation. Students will work through tensor operations, mathematical foundations, and forward pass mechanics - essential skills for upcoming deep learning projects.
### **Class Session Plan:**
  1. GitHub Sync (15 mins) - Ensure all students have latest exercise materials
  2. Sequential Lab Execution - Work through 6 structured exercises:
    - Tensor creation and manipulation
    - Mathematical operations and broadcasting
    - Activation functions implementation
    - Reduction operations for loss calculation
    - Complete neural network forward pass
    - MLP theory and practical implementation

  **Learning Outcomes:** Students will gain practical experience with TensorFlow's core operations, understand the mathematical foundations of neural networks, and be prepared for advanced deep learning concepts in subsequent weeks.

  **Technical Requirements:** Python environment with TensorFlow, Jupyter notebooks, and GitHub access for collaborative learning.
