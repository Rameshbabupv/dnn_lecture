# Exercise 1: Tensor Creation & Manipulation

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Understand TensorFlow tensor hierarchy (0D → 3D)
- Distinguish between constants and variables
- Master shape manipulation operations
- Grasp the relationship between tensors and neural network data flow

## 📝 **Line-by-Line Code Explanations**

### **Creating Basic Tensors**

```python
scalar = tf.constant(42)
```
**Instructor Explanation**: 
- "This creates a 0-dimensional tensor (scalar). Think of it as a single number wrapped in TensorFlow's tensor format."
- "Why `tf.constant`? Because this value won't change during computation - it's immutable."

**Common Student Questions**:
- **Q**: "Why not just use `42` directly?"
- **A**: "Python integers can't participate in TensorFlow's computational graph. Only tensors can flow through neural network operations."

- **Q**: "When would we use scalars in neural networks?"
- **A**: "Learning rates, regularization coefficients, any hyperparameter that affects computation."

```python
vector = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
**Instructor Explanation**:
- "This is a 1D tensor representing a feature vector. In neural networks, this could be input features for a single sample."
- "The shape is (5,) - 5 elements in one dimension."

```python
matrix = tf.ones((3, 3))
```
**Instructor Explanation**:
- "2D tensor (matrix) - fundamental for neural network weights and data batches."
- "Why `tf.ones` instead of `tf.constant`? When we want all elements to have the same value, initialization functions are cleaner."

**Alternative Approaches Discussion**:
- "Could use `tf.constant([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])` but that's verbose"
- "Could use `tf.fill((3,3), 1.0)` - explain when each is appropriate"

### **Variables vs Constants Deep Dive**

```python
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 3), stddev=0.1), name="weights")
```

**Instructor Explanation**:
- "`tf.Variable` creates trainable parameters - these will be updated during learning"
- "`tf.random.normal()` initializes with random values from normal distribution"
- "`stddev=0.1` keeps initial weights small - explain why this matters for gradient flow"
- "`name=` helps with debugging and visualization"

**Student Questions You'll Get**:
- **Q**: "Why random initialization? Why not zeros?"
- **A**: "Zero initialization causes symmetry breaking problem. All neurons would learn identical features. Random initialization ensures diversity."

- **Q**: "Why standard deviation 0.1?"
- **A**: "Balance between too small (vanishing gradients) and too large (exploding gradients). This is Xavier/He initialization territory - preview of advanced topics."

### **Shape Manipulation**

```python
reshaped = tf.reshape(original, (4, 2))
```

**Critical Teaching Point**:
- "Reshape doesn't change data, only how we view it. Total elements must remain constant."
- "Draw this on board: 2×4 matrix → 4×2 matrix, same 8 elements"

**Common Confusion**:
- Students think reshape changes the data values
- Demonstrate with simple example: `[1,2,3,4]` → `[[1,2],[3,4]]`

## 🤔 **Anticipated Student Questions & Answers**

### **Q: "Why do we need so many ways to create tensors?"**
**A**: Each serves different purposes:
- `tf.constant()`: Known values that won't change
- `tf.Variable()`: Parameters that will be trained
- `tf.zeros()`, `tf.ones()`: Clean initialization
- `tf.random.normal()`: Proper weight initialization

### **Q: "What's the difference between shape (3,) and (3,1)?"**
**A**: 
- `(3,)`: 1D vector with 3 elements
- `(3,1)`: 2D matrix with 3 rows, 1 column
- Demonstrate broadcasting differences

### **Q: "When would we use 3D tensors?"**
**A**: 
- Batch of images: (batch_size, height, width)
- Time series: (batch_size, time_steps, features)
- CNN feature maps: (batch_size, height, width, channels)

## ⚠️ **Common Student Errors**

1. **Shape Mismatches**: 
   - Error: Trying to reshape incompatible dimensions
   - Solution: Check total element count

2. **Variable vs Constant Confusion**:
   - Error: Using `tf.constant()` for weights
   - Solution: Explain mutability requirements

3. **Broadcasting Confusion**:
   - Error: Expecting shape errors that don't occur
   - Solution: Explain TensorFlow's broadcasting rules

# Exercise 2: Mathematical Operations

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Master element-wise vs matrix operations
- Understand broadcasting rules
- Connect mathematical operations to neural network computations

## 📝 **Detailed Code Explanations**

### **Element-wise Operations**

```python
addition = tf.add(a, b)  # or a + b
```

**Teaching Points**:
- "Element-wise: corresponding elements are combined"
- "Both tensors must have compatible shapes (broadcasting rules apply)"
- "Show visually: `[[1,2],[3,4]] + [[5,6],[7,8]] = [[6,8],[10,12]]`"

**Why This Matters in Neural Networks**:
- Bias addition: `output = weights @ inputs + bias`
- Activation combinations
- Residual connections

### **Matrix Multiplication - THE Critical Operation**

```python
matrix_mult = tf.matmul(a, b)
```

**Extended Explanation**:
- "This is the heart of neural networks. Every layer is essentially matrix multiplication."
- "Dimensions must be compatible: (m,n) × (n,p) → (m,p)"
- "Each output element is dot product of row and column"

**Visual Teaching Technique**:
```
Input Layer    Weight Matrix    Output Layer
   [1]             [0.1 0.4]       [?]
   [2]     ×       [0.2 0.5]   =   [?]
   [3]             [0.3 0.6]
   
Calculate: [1×0.1 + 2×0.2 + 3×0.3, 1×0.4 + 2×0.5 + 3×0.6]
```

### **Broadcasting Deep Dive**

```python
broadcast_result = matrix + scalar_value
```

**Complex Topic - Break It Down**:
- "TensorFlow automatically expands smaller tensor"
- "Rules: Start from rightmost dimension, work left"
- "Dimensions are compatible if: equal, one is 1, or one doesn't exist"

**Common Broadcasting Examples**:
```python
(3, 1) + (3,)    → (3, 3)   # OK
(2, 3) + (3,)    → (2, 3)   # OK  
(2, 3) + (2, 1)  → (2, 3)   # OK
(2, 3) + (2, 4)  → ERROR    # Incompatible
```

## 🤔 **Student Questions You'll Face**

### **Q: "Why `tf.matmul()` instead of `*`?"**
**A**: 
- "`*` is element-wise multiplication"
- "`tf.matmul()` or `@` is matrix multiplication"
- "Different mathematical operations with different uses"

### **Q: "When do we use element-wise vs matrix multiplication?"**
**A**:
- **Matrix multiplication**: Layer-to-layer transformations
- **Element-wise**: Applying activations, adding bias, combining features

### **Q: "Why does broadcasting exist? Isn't it confusing?"**
**A**:
- "Efficiency: avoid explicitly repeating data"
- "Natural mathematical operations: adding bias to all neurons"
- "Memory savings in large networks"

## ⚠️ **Debugging This Exercise**

### **Common Error: Shape Incompatibility**
```python
# Student tries:
a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3]])        # Shape: (1, 3)
b = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])   # Shape: (2, 2)
result = tf.matmul(a, b)            # ERROR!
```

**How to Explain**:
- "Matrix multiplication requires inner dimensions to match"
- "Here: (1,3) × (2,2) - 3 ≠ 2, so incompatible"
- "Solution: transpose, reshape, or check data preparation"

# Exercise 3: Activation Functions

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Understand why neural networks need non-linearity
- Compare different activation functions and their properties
- Connect mathematical functions to neural network behavior

## 📝 **Deep Mathematical Explanations**

### **ReLU - The Workhorse**

```python
relu_output = tf.nn.relu(x)
```

**Complete Explanation**:
- "ReLU(x) = max(0, x). Simple but powerful."
- "Why ReLU revolutionized deep learning: no vanishing gradient for positive inputs"
- "Biological inspiration: neurons either fire or don't"

**Mathematical Properties**:
- Non-linear but simple to compute
- Derivative: 1 for x>0, 0 for x≤0
- Sparse activation (many zeros)

### **Sigmoid - The Classic**

```python
sigmoid_output = tf.nn.sigmoid(x)
```

**Historical Context**:
- "Original neural network activation"
- "σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x))"
- "Output range: (0,1) - good for probabilities"

**Why It's Problematic**:
- Vanishing gradient problem
- Not zero-centered
- Computationally expensive

### **Softmax - The Classifier**

```python
softmax_output = tf.nn.softmax(logits)
```

**Critical for Understanding**:
- "Converts logits to probability distribution"
- "Sum always equals 1.0"
- "Emphasizes largest input (winner-take-all tendency)"

**Mathematical Formula Explanation**:
```
softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / Σ(exp(x_j))
```

## 🤔 **Deep Student Questions**

### **Q: "Why do we need activation functions at all?"**
**A**: This is THE fundamental question. Demonstrate:
```python
# Without activation:
layer1 = tf.matmul(input, W1) + b1
layer2 = tf.matmul(layer1, W2) + b2  
# This is equivalent to: tf.matmul(input, W1*W2) + (b1*W2 + b2)
# Just one linear transformation!
```

### **Q: "Why ReLU over sigmoid?"**
**A**: 
- **Gradient flow**: ReLU doesn't saturate for positive inputs
- **Computation**: Much faster (no exponentials)
- **Sparsity**: Natural feature selection
- **Empirical results**: Simply works better in practice

### **Q: "When would we use different activations?"**
**A**:
- **ReLU**: Hidden layers (default choice)
- **Sigmoid**: Binary classification output, gates in RNNs
- **Softmax**: Multi-class classification output
- **Tanh**: Sometimes in RNNs (zero-centered)

### **Q: "Why does softmax sum to 1?"**
**A**: "It's designed to output probability distribution. Each output represents probability of belonging to that class."

## 🧪 **Teaching Demonstrations**

### **Visual Activation Comparison**
Create this demonstration:
```python
x_range = tf.linspace(-5.0, 5.0, 100)
relu_demo = tf.nn.relu(x_range)
sigmoid_demo = tf.nn.sigmoid(x_range)
tanh_demo = tf.nn.tanh(x_range)
```

**Point out**:
- ReLU's hard threshold at 0
- Sigmoid's smooth curve, saturation at extremes
- Tanh's symmetry around origin

# Exercise 4: Reduction Operations

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Understand how to aggregate tensor data
- Master axis-specific operations
- Connect reductions to neural network computations (loss functions, normalization)

## 📝 **Axis Confusion Resolution**

### **The Axis Concept - Biggest Student Confusion**

```python
data = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)
sum_rows = tf.reduce_sum(data, axis=1)    # [6, 15]
sum_cols = tf.reduce_sum(data, axis=0)    # [5, 7, 9]
```

**Visual Teaching Method**:
```
Original matrix:
    [1  2  3]  ← Row 0
    [4  5  6]  ← Row 1
    ↑  ↑  ↑
  Col0 Col1 Col2

axis=0 (collapse rows): [1+4, 2+5, 3+6] = [5, 7, 9]
axis=1 (collapse cols): [1+2+3, 4+5+6] = [6, 15]
```

**Memory Device**: "Axis number = which dimension disappears"

### **Statistical Operations**

```python
mean_val = tf.reduce_mean(data)
std_val = tf.math.reduce_std(data)
```

**Neural Network Applications**:
- **Mean**: Computing average loss across batch
- **Std**: Batch normalization
- **Max**: Max pooling in CNNs
- **Min**: Clipping operations

## 🤔 **Student Questions About Axes**

### **Q: "Why does axis=0 sum across rows, not sum rows?"**
**A**: "Think of axis as which index changes. axis=0 means the first index (row index) varies while others stay fixed."

### **Q: "How do I remember which axis does what?"**
**A**: "axis=0 → changes rows (vertical), axis=1 → changes columns (horizontal). Or: axis number = dimension that disappears."

### **Q: "Why would we want axis-specific operations?"**
**A**:
- Computing loss per sample vs total loss
- Normalizing features vs samples
- Finding max probability per prediction

# Exercise 5: Neural Network Forward Pass

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Implement complete neural network computation
- Understand weight initialization strategies
- Connect mathematical operations to neural network layers

## 📝 **Critical Implementation Details**

### **Weight Initialization**

```python
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([input_size, hidden_size], stddev=0.1), name="W1")
```

**Deep Explanation**:
- "Random initialization breaks symmetry"
- "stddev=0.1 is conservative but safe"
- "Too large → exploding gradients, too small → vanishing gradients"

**Alternative Approaches Discussion**:
```python
# Xavier/Glorot initialization
limit = tf.sqrt(6.0 / (input_size + hidden_size))
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform([input_size, hidden_size], -limit, limit))

# He initialization (for ReLU)
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([input_size, hidden_size], 
                                 stddev=tf.sqrt(2.0/input_size)))
```

### **Forward Pass Step-by-Step**

```python
hidden_pre = tf.matmul(inputs, W1) + b1
hidden_activated = tf.nn.relu(hidden_pre)
output_pre = tf.matmul(hidden_activated, W2) + b2
outputs = tf.nn.sigmoid(output_pre)
```

**Teaching Approach**:
1. "Linear transformation: mix inputs with weights"
2. "Add bias: shift the activation threshold"
3. "Apply activation: introduce non-linearity"
4. "Repeat for next layer"

**Dimension Tracking Exercise**:
```
inputs:         (2, 3)  [batch_size=2, features=3]
W1:             (3, 4)  [input_features=3, hidden_units=4]
hidden_pre:     (2, 4)  [batch_size=2, hidden_units=4]
hidden_activated: (2, 4)  [same shape after activation]
W2:             (4, 2)  [hidden_units=4, output_units=2]
outputs:        (2, 2)  [batch_size=2, output_units=2]
```

## 🤔 **Complex Student Questions**

### **Q: "Why add bias? Isn't the weight matrix enough?"**
**A**: "Bias provides offset independence. Without bias, your activation function is forced to pass through origin. Bias allows shifting the activation threshold."

**Demonstration**:
```python
# Without bias: y = W*x (line through origin)
# With bias: y = W*x + b (line can be anywhere)
```

### **Q: "Why this specific network architecture?"**
**A**: 
- "3 inputs → 4 hidden → 2 outputs is just an example"
- "Hidden layer size often between input and output size"
- "No theoretical rule, mostly empirical"

### **Q: "Why ReLU in hidden layer but sigmoid in output?"**
**A**:
- "Hidden layers need non-linearity but want gradient flow → ReLU"
- "Output layer depends on task: sigmoid for binary classification, softmax for multi-class, linear for regression"

## ⚠️ **Common Implementation Errors**

### **Shape Mismatches**
Students often get dimensions wrong:
```python
# Wrong:
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([hidden_size, input_size]))  # Transposed!

# Correct:
W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([input_size, hidden_size]))
```

**Teaching Tip**: "Always think: input_size × hidden_size for matrix multiplication to work"

# Exercise 7: Data Preprocessing

# Exercise 6: XOR Problem Implementation

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Understand why linear models fail on XOR
- See how hidden layers enable non-linear classification
- Connect theoretical concepts to practical implementation

## 📝 **The XOR Problem - Historical Context**

### **Why XOR Matters**

```python
X = tf.constant([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_true = tf.constant([[0], [1], [1], [0]], dtype=tf.float32)
```

**Historical Significance**:
- "Minsky & Papert (1969) showed single-layer perceptrons can't solve XOR"
- "Led to 'AI Winter' until backpropagation was discovered"
- "XOR requires non-linear decision boundary"

**Visual Explanation**: Draw XOR on coordinate plane:
- (0,0) → 0, (1,1) → 0 (same class)
- (0,1) → 1, (1,0) → 1 (same class)
- "No single line can separate these classes!"

### **The Solution - Clever Weight Values**

```python
W1 = tf.Variable([[10.0, -10.0], [10.0, -10.0]], name="hidden_weights")
b1 = tf.Variable([-5.0, 15.0], name="hidden_bias")
```

**Explain Each Weight**:
- **First hidden neuron**: `10*x1 + 10*x2 - 5`
  - Fires when x1 OR x2 is 1 (OR gate)
- **Second hidden neuron**: `-10*x1 + -10*x2 + 15`
  - Fires when x1 AND x2 are both 0 (NOR gate)

**Output Layer**:
```python
W2 = tf.Variable([[10.0], [10.0]], name="output_weights")
b2 = tf.Variable([-15.0], name="output_bias")
```
- Combines: "OR AND NOT(AND)" = XOR

### **Step-by-Step Computation**

**For input [0,1]**:
1. Hidden layer: `[10*0 + 10*1 - 5, -10*0 + -10*1 + 15] = [5, 5]`
2. After sigmoid: `[σ(5), σ(5)] ≈ [0.99, 0.99]`
3. Output: `10*0.99 + 10*0.99 - 15 ≈ 4.8`
4. After sigmoid: `σ(4.8) ≈ 0.99` ✓

## 🤔 **Deep Conceptual Questions**

### **Q: "How did you know these specific weight values?"**
**A**: 
- "This is a manually crafted solution to demonstrate the concept"
- "In practice, we'd use gradient descent to learn these automatically"
- "The values are large to make sigmoid behave like step functions"

### **Q: "Why do we need sigmoid activation here?"**
**A**:
- "Sigmoid compresses output to (0,1) range"
- "Large positive inputs → ~1, large negative → ~0"
- "Acts like smooth step function with these large weights"

### **Q: "Could we solve XOR with different architectures?"**
**A**:
- "Yes! Different hidden layer sizes, different activations"
- "But you always need at least one hidden layer for non-linearity"
- "This is the minimal solution: 2 hidden neurons"

### **Q: "Why is XOR accuracy not exactly 1.0?"**
**A**:
- "Sigmoid never reaches exactly 0 or 1"
- "Could use larger weights for sharper transitions"
- "Or different activation functions (like step function)"

## 🧪 **Teaching Demonstrations**

### **Linear vs Non-linear Visualization**
1. Show single-layer perceptron failing on XOR
2. Show how hidden layer creates new feature space
3. Demonstrate that XOR becomes linearly separable in hidden space

### **Weight Sensitivity Analysis**
Change weights slightly and show impact:
```python
# Demonstrate sensitivity
W1_modified = tf.Variable([[8.0, -8.0], [8.0, -8.0]])  # Smaller weights
# Show how accuracy changes
```

---

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Understand why preprocessing is crucial for neural networks
- Master different normalization techniques
- Learn categorical data encoding for neural networks

## 📝 **Preprocessing Rationale**

### **Z-Score Normalization**

```python
normalized = (raw_data - mean) / std
```

**Why This Matters**:
- "Neural networks are sensitive to input scale"
- "Features with larger scales dominate gradient updates"
- "Example: [age: 25, salary: 50000] - salary overwhelms age"

**Mathematical Explanation**:
- "Transforms data to mean=0, std=1"
- "Preserves distribution shape, changes scale"
- "Negative values are okay - they carry information"

### **Min-Max Scaling**

```python
scaled_data = (raw_data - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
```

**When to Use**:
- "When you need specific range [0,1]"
- "When distribution is uniform"
- "When you know the theoretical min/max"

**Comparison with Z-score**:
- Min-Max: bounded range, sensitive to outliers
- Z-score: unbounded, more robust to outliers

### **One-Hot Encoding**

```python
one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=3)
```

**Critical Concept**:
- "Categorical data can't be directly fed to neural networks"
- "Neural networks need numerical inputs"
- "One-hot prevents artificial ordering (class 2 ≠ twice class 1)"

## 🤔 **Student Questions About Preprocessing**

### **Q: "Why not just divide by the maximum value?"**
**A**: 
- "That's actually min-max scaling when min=0"
- "Doesn't handle negative values well"
- "Doesn't center the data around 0"

### **Q: "When should I use which normalization?"**
**A**:
- **Z-score**: Most neural networks, unknown data distribution
- **Min-Max**: When you need specific bounds, uniform distributions
- **Robust scaling**: When you have outliers

### **Q: "Why does one-hot encoding create so many dimensions?"**
**A**:
- "Trade-off: expressiveness vs dimensionality"
- "Alternative: embeddings for high-cardinality categories"
- "Each dimension represents one possible category"

### **Q: "What if test data has different min/max than training?"**
**A**: 
- "Always use training statistics for normalization"
- "Test data uses same transformation as training"
- "This is a crucial point for deployment"

## ⚠️ **Common Preprocessing Mistakes**

1. **Normalizing before train/test split**
2. **Using test statistics for normalization**
3. **Forgetting to normalize new data**
4. **Mixing normalization techniques**

# Exercise 8: Debugging & Error Handling

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
- Develop systematic debugging approaches
- Understand common TensorFlow errors
- Build defensive programming habits

## 📝 **Debugging Methodology**

### **The Debug Function**

```python
def debug_tensor(tensor, name):
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  Shape: {tensor.shape}")
    print(f"  Rank: {tf.rank(tensor).numpy()}")
    print(f"  Data type: {tensor.dtype}")
    print(f"  Size: {tf.size(tensor).numpy()}")
```

**Teaching Points**:
- "Always check shape first - most errors are shape mismatches"
- "Rank = number of dimensions"
- "Size = total number of elements"
- "Data type mismatches cause subtle bugs"

### **Shape Compatibility Checking**

```python
print(f"Can multiply {tensor_a.shape} × {tensor_b.shape}? {tensor_a.shape[-1] == tensor_b.shape[0]}")
```

**Explain the Logic**:
- "Matrix multiplication: (m,n) × (n,p) → (m,p)"
- "Check: does inner dimension match?"
- "Always verify before expensive operations"

### **Value Validation**

```python
has_inf = tf.reduce_any(tf.math.is_inf(problematic_values)).numpy()
has_nan = tf.reduce_any(tf.math.is_nan(problematic_values)).numpy()
```

**Why This Matters**:
- "Inf/NaN values break neural network training"
- "Often result from division by zero or overflow"
- "Early detection saves debugging time"

## 🤔 **Debugging Questions Students Ask**

### **Q: "What's the most common error in neural networks?"**
**A**: "Shape mismatches, by far. Usually from incorrect matrix dimensions or broadcasting assumptions."

### **Q: "How do I debug shape errors?"**
**A**: "Print shapes at every step. Use the debug function religiously. Draw the dimensions on paper."

### **Q: "Why do I get NaN values?"**
**A**:
- Learning rate too high
- Gradient explosion
- Division by zero in custom operations
- Poor weight initialization

### **Q: "What does 'incompatible shapes' mean exactly?"**
**A**: Walk through specific example:
```python
a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3]])     # Shape: (1, 3)
b = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) # Shape: (2, 2)
# tf.matmul(a, b) fails because 3 ≠ 2
```

## 🔧 **Error Scenarios to Demonstrate**

### **1. Shape Mismatch**
```python
# Intentional error for teaching
try:
    wrong_mult = tf.matmul(tf.ones((2, 3)), tf.ones((4, 5)))
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

### **2. Data Type Mismatch**
```python
# Mixing data types
int_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
float_tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
# Some operations may fail or give unexpected results
```

### **3. Gradient Issues**
```python
# Exploding values
large_weights = tf.Variable(tf.ones((100, 100)) * 100)
# Show how this leads to overflow
```

### **"When should I worry about optimization?"**
**Answer**:
- Not during learning phase
- When training takes too long
- When memory usage is problematic
- When deploying to production

# Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **Emergency Fixes for Common Issues**

### **Student Can't Import TensorFlow**
1. Check Python version (3.7+)
2. Try: `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`
3. Virtual environment issues
4. M1 Mac specific: `pip install tensorflow-macos`

### **"Out of Memory" Errors**
1. Reduce batch sizes in examples
2. Use Google Colab
3. Close other applications
4. Check for infinite loops creating large tensors

### **Dimension Errors**
1. Print all shapes: `print(f"Shape: {tensor.shape}")`
2. Use `tf.reshape()` to fix
3. Check axis parameters in reductions
4. Verify matrix multiplication compatibility

### **Strange Results**
1. Check data types (int vs float)
2. Verify input ranges
3. Look for NaN/Inf values
4. Check activation function choices

## 📚 **Reference Materials for Students**

### **Must-Know Functions**
- **Creation**: `tf.constant`, `tf.Variable`, `tf.zeros`, `tf.ones`, `tf.random.normal`
- **Math**: `tf.add`, `tf.matmul`, `tf.multiply`
- **Activations**: `tf.nn.relu`, `tf.nn.sigmoid`, `tf.nn.softmax`
- **Reductions**: `tf.reduce_sum`, `tf.reduce_mean`, `tf.reduce_max`
- **Shape**: `tf.reshape`, `tf.transpose`, `tf.rank`, `tf.shape`

# Teaching Tips & Best Practices

## 🎯 **Classroom Management**

### **Pacing**
- Exercise 1-2: 15 minutes (foundation)
- Exercise 3-4: 15 minutes (core concepts)
- Exercise 5-6: 20 minutes (application)
- Exercise 7-8: 10 minutes (practical skills)

### **Interactive Elements**
- Have students predict shapes before running code
- Ask them to explain errors to each other
- Use pair programming for debugging exercises
- Regular "shape checks" throughout the session

### **Common Pitfalls**
- Students rush through without understanding
- Focus on syntax instead of concepts
- Skip error-checking practices
- Don't connect to neural network theory

## 🎪 **Engagement Strategies**

### **Make It Memorable**
- "Shape is life" - emphasize constantly
- Use analogies: tensors as boxes, operations as factories
- Connect every operation to neural network purpose
- Celebrate successful debugging

### **Encourage Exploration**
- "What happens if we change this?"
- "Try different activation functions"
- "Experiment with different shapes"
- "Break it on purpose, then fix it"
