## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Q: Can I use MNIST instead of Fashion-MNIST?
**A:** Yes, but Fashion-MNIST is preferred because:
- More challenging (~90% vs ~98% accuracy)
- More realistic (actual image classification)
- Same format/API as MNIST
- Better prepares for real-world datasets

### Q: Why is my training slow?
**A:**
- **CPU training:** Normal, 2-3 minutes expected
- **Speed up:** Use Google Colab GPU (Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU)
- **Alternative:** Reduce batch size or train on subset

### Q: Model accuracy stuck at 10%?
**A:** Common causes (see troubleshooting_guide.md):
1. Forgot to normalize data (divide by 255)
2. Wrong loss function for label format
3. Learning rate too high
Check troubleshooting guide Section 4, Error 10.

### Q: Shape mismatch error?
**A:** Most likely forgot to reshape:
```python
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)  # Add channel dimension
```
See troubleshooting_guide.md Section 3, Error 6.

### Q: Can I modify the architecture?
**A:** Yes! That's the point of Homework Task 3. Experiment with:
- Different numbers of filters
- Different kernel sizes
- Additional conv blocks
- Dropout layers
- Batch normalization

### Q: How do I run the notebook in Google Colab?
**A:**
1. Upload `.ipynb` to Google Drive
2. Right-click ‚Üí Open with ‚Üí Google Colaboratory
3. Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU (optional)
4. Run cells sequentially
