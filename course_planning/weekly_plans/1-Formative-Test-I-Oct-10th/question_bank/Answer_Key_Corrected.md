# PART A: 1-MARK QUESTIONS - COMPLETE SOLUTIONS

## Q1. The XOR problem cannot be solved by a single perceptron because:
**Answer**: b) It is not linearly separable

**Explanation**: XOR requires separating points (0,1) and (1,0) from (0,0) and (1,1). No single straight line can achieve this separation, making it a non-linearly separable problem.

---

## Q2. In TensorFlow, which data structure is the fundamental building block?
**Answer**: c) Tensor

**Explanation**: Tensors are N-dimensional arrays that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices. All TensorFlow operations work on tensors, hence the name "TensorFlow."

---

## Q3. The sigmoid activation function outputs values in the range:
**Answer**: b) (0, 1)

**Explanation**: Sigmoid function σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x)) asymptotically approaches 0 and 1 but never reaches them, making the range (0, 1).

---

## Q4. Which loss function is typically used for binary classification?
**Answer**: c) Binary Cross-entropy

**Explanation**: Binary cross-entropy L = -[y×log(ŷ) + (1-y)×log(1-ŷ)] is designed for binary classification with sigmoid output.

---

## Q5. Which activation function can output negative values?
**Answer**: c) Tanh

**Explanation**: Tanh function outputs values in range [-1, 1], while sigmoid outputs [0, 1] and ReLU outputs [0, ∞).

---

## Q6. The perceptron learning algorithm can solve:
**Answer**: a) Only linearly separable problems

**Explanation**: Single perceptron creates linear decision boundary and cannot solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR.

---

## Q7. Which TensorFlow function is used to create a tensor filled with zeros?
**Answer**: b) tf.zeros()

**Explanation**: tf.zeros(shape) creates tensor of specified shape filled with zeros. Example: tf.zeros([3, 4]) creates 3×4 zero matrix.

---

## Q8. Which type of neural network layer performs weighted sum of inputs?
**Answer**: b) Dense layer

**Explanation**: Dense (fully connected) layer computes output = activation(dot(input, weights) + bias).

---

## Q9. In forward propagation, the output of each layer is:
**Answer**: b) Input to the next layer

**Explanation**: Data flows forward through network: output of layer i becomes input to layer i+1.

---

## Q10. The softmax activation function is primarily used for:
**Answer**: b) Multi-class classification

**Explanation**: Softmax converts raw scores to probabilities that sum to 1, perfect for multi-class classification.

---

## Q11. Which activation function is most commonly used in hidden layers of modern deep networks?
**Answer**: c) ReLU

**Explanation**: ReLU solves vanishing gradient problem and is computationally efficient, making it default choice for hidden layers.

---

## Q12. The backpropagation algorithm uses which mathematical concept?
**Answer**: b) Chain rule of differentiation

**Explanation**: Backpropagation applies chain rule to compute gradients: ∂L/∂w = ∂L/∂y × ∂y/∂z × ∂z/∂w.

---

## Q13. The derivative of ReLU function for positive inputs is:
**Answer**: b) 1

**Explanation**: ReLU(x) = max(0, x), so derivative is 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0.

---

## Q14. The bias term in a neuron:
**Answer**: b) Allows shifting of the activation function

**Explanation**: Bias shifts activation function horizontally, enabling non-zero output when all inputs are zero.

---

## Q15. In a multilayer perceptron, the universal approximation theorem states:
**Answer**: b) A single hidden layer can approximate any continuous function

**Explanation**: Proven by Cybenko (1989): single hidden layer with sufficient neurons can approximate any continuous function.
