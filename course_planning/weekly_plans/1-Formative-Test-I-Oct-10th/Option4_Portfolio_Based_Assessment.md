## FAQ

**Q: Can I use external libraries beyond TensorFlow?**
A: Yes, but document your choices and ensure they add value to your implementation.

**Q: How detailed should the code comments be?**
A: Explain your logic, design decisions, and any non-obvious implementations.

**Q: What if my enhanced scripts don't work perfectly?**
A: Partial credit given for working solutions. Document known issues and attempted fixes.

**Q: Can I collaborate on the novel project?**
A: No, this must be individual work. However, you can discuss approaches conceptually.

**Q: How long should the reflection report be?**
A: 3-5 pages is sufficient. Focus on quality of insights, not length.
