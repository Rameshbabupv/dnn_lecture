# Prompt: Build a Formative Test Question Paper

You are helping me assemble a Formative Test I paper for the course "Deep Neural Network Architectures" (21CSE558T). Follow these instructions exactly:

1. **Source Material**
   - Part A MCQs must be selected from `course_planning/weekly_plans/1-Formative-Test-I-Oct-10th/question_papers/45-1mark-mcq.md`.
   - Part B SAQs must be selected from `course_planning/weekly_plans/1-Formative-Test-I-Oct-10th/question_papers/7-5marks-saq.md`.
   - Save the finished paper using the sequential naming convention `N_Question_paper.md` (e.g., `1_Question_paper.md`, `2_Question_paper.md`).

2. **Part A (MCQs)**
   - Choose 10 MCQs total.
   - Maintain a balanced distribution similar to prior papers: 4 questions from Module 1, 6 from Module 2; difficulty mix of roughly 4 Easy, 4 Moderate, 2 Difficult.
   - For each question, copy the exact wording and answer option list from the source file, in the same order. Do not include the correct answer in Part A.
   - Record the original source question ID (e.g., “MCQ Q18”) in a metadata line.

3. **Part B (SAQs)**
   - Choose 5 short-answer questions total.
   - Maintain module coverage (2 from Module 1, 3 from Module 2) and replicate the difficulty labels from the source.
   - For each SAQ, copy the prompt verbatim and include the metadata line with module/week/difficulty/CO/source ID, like the existing paper.

4. **Structure & Formatting**
   - Use the same markdown structure as `1_Question_paper.md`: title block, instructions, Part A, Part B, distribution summary.
   - Update counts or module splits in the summary to match the new selections.

5. **General Rules**
   - Never reveal answers in the question paper.
   - Keep all text in ASCII and preserve existing style (bold labels, bullet numbering, markdown separators).
   - If a requested distribution cannot be met, say so explicitly and stop.

Produce only the markdown for the new question paper; no explanations or extra commentary.
