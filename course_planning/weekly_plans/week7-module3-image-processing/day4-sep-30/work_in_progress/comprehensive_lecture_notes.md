# 🔍 TOPIC 1: THE DETECTIVE'S DILEMMA - Why Edge Detection? (18 minutes)

## The Crime Scene Challenge (7 minutes)

**Meet Detective Sarah at the City Museum Burglary**

Last night, someone broke into the city museum. Sarah arrives at a chaotic crime scene - paintings, sculptures, and artifacts scattered everywhere. Her job? Find the evidence that reveals what happened.

**Sarah's Human Investigation Process:**
1. **Scan the room** - her eyes automatically find boundaries
2. **Identify objects** - she sees where one thing ends and another begins
3. **Focus on edges** - broken glass outline, footprint boundaries, displaced painting frames
4. **Piece together the story** - these boundaries tell her the sequence of events

**The Breakthrough Moment:**
Sarah realizes something profound: *"I'm not looking AT objects - I'm looking at the BOUNDARIES between objects!"*

**🧠 The Computer's Challenge:**
Unlike Sarah, a computer sees this:
```
Museum Crime Scene (Computer's View):
[142, 156, 134, 198, 87, 203, 156, 167, 178, 134, ...]
Just numbers! No objects, no boundaries, no meaning.
```

But we want the computer to see this:
```
Museum Crime Scene (What We Want):
- Wall edges
- Painting frames
- Scattered objects
- Evidence boundaries
```

**💡 The Edge Detection Mission:**
> "Teach computers to see boundaries the way Detective Sarah sees them naturally"

**Interactive Question:** *"When you walk into a room, how do you instantly know where the table ends and the floor begins? Your brain is doing edge detection!"*

## Why Boundaries Matter (6 minutes)

**Detective Sarah's Insight:**
*"In any investigation, the most important evidence lies at the boundaries - where one thing becomes another."*

**Real-World Boundary Examples:**
- **Medical X-rays:** Where does healthy tissue end and the tumor begin?
- **Self-driving cars:** Where does the road end and the sidewalk begin?
- **Quality control:** Where does the product end and the defect begin?
- **Face recognition:** Where does the face end and the background begin?

**The Human Advantage:**
From birth, humans effortlessly detect edges:
- A baby instantly sees mom's face outline
- A child knows where toys end and floor begins
- We navigate by recognizing boundaries everywhere

**The Computer Disadvantage:**
Computers see pixel intensity values:
```
What humans see: [Object] | [Background]
What computers see: 134, 156, 142, 167, 203, 187...
```

**🎯 Our Educational Goal:**
Transform computer vision from **"seeing numbers"** to **"seeing boundaries"**

**Book Reference:** *Chollet's "Deep Learning with Python"* explains: "Edge detection is the foundation that enables CNNs to build hierarchical understanding of visual scenes."

## The Detective's Toolkit Preview (5 minutes)

**Detective Sarah's Investigation Methods:**

**Method 1 - The Quick Scan (Sobel Method):**
*"I'll quickly scan horizontally and vertically to find obvious boundaries"*
- Like Sarah checking left-right, then up-down
- Fast but sometimes misses subtle clues

**Method 2 - The Thorough Investigation (Canny Method):**
*"I'll follow my proven 4-step investigation protocol"*
- Clean the scene → Find all evidence → Eliminate false clues → Connect the dots
- Slower but much more reliable

**Visual Analogy:**
```
Sarah's Eyes (Human):          Computer's Challenge:
👁️ Instantly sees edges        🤖 Must calculate every boundary
⚡ Effortless recognition      🔢 Mathematical analysis required
🧠 Built-in edge detection     📊 Needs our algorithms
```

# ⛰️ TOPIC 2: THE MOUNTAIN GUIDE'S WISDOM - Understanding Gradients (17 minutes)

## Captain Mike's Mountain Rescue Story (8 minutes)

**Meet Captain Mike, Expert Mountain Rescue Leader**

Captain Mike leads rescue operations on Mount DataPeak. When hikers get lost in dense fog, his team must map dangerous cliff edges to plan safe rescue routes.

**The Fog Problem:**
*"In thick fog, you can't see the cliffs directly - but you CAN feel when the ground suddenly drops!"*

**Mike's Gradient Discovery:**
- **Gentle slope:** Safe to walk, gradual height change
- **Steep cliff:** Dangerous drop, rapid height change
- **Flat area:** No danger, no height change

**Mike's Two-Team Strategy:**
```
Team Alpha (East-West scouts): "How steep is it if I go east or west?"
Team Beta (North-South scouts): "How steep is it if I go north or south?"

Combined Intel: Complete steepness map of the mountain
```

**🧠 The Image Processing Connection:**

In images, **pixel intensity** is like **mountain height:**
- Bright pixels = High peaks
- Dark pixels = Deep valleys
- Sudden brightness changes = Steep cliffs (EDGES!)

**Captain Mike's Gradient Formula:**
*"Steepness = How much the height changes when you take one step"*

**Mathematical Translation:**
```
Mountain steepness = Height change per step
Image gradient = Intensity change per pixel
```

## The Two-Direction Survey (6 minutes)

**Why Captain Mike Needs Two Teams:**

**Scenario: The Hidden Cliff**
```
Team Alpha Report: "No danger going east-west"
Team Beta Report: "CLIFF ALERT going north-south!"

Result: Cliff runs east-west (horizontal cliff)
```

**Image Translation:**
```
Horizontal edge (like east-west cliff):
- High vertical gradient (north-south change)
- Low horizontal gradient (east-west change)

Vertical edge (like north-south cliff):
- High horizontal gradient (east-west change)
- Low vertical gradient (north-south change)
```

**The Sobel Brothers' Survey Equipment:**

Meet Sam and Steve Sobel, Mike's equipment specialists:

**Sam's X-Direction Equipment (Detects Vertical Cliffs):**
```
[-1  0  1]    "Compare left vs right"
[-2  0  2]    "Give more weight to direct neighbors"
[-1  0  1]    "Ignore the center (where we stand)"
```

**Steve's Y-Direction Equipment (Detects Horizontal Cliffs):**
```
[-1 -2 -1]    "Compare above vs below"
[ 0  0  0]    "Give more weight to direct neighbors"
[ 1  2  1]    "Ignore the center (where we stand)"
```

**Simple Code Example:**
```python
# Captain Mike's mountain survey in action
sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)  # Sam's east-west survey
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)  # Steve's north-south survey
cliff_map = np.sqrt(sobel_x**2 + sobel_y**2)           # Combined danger map
```

## Reading the Danger Map (3 minutes)

**Captain Mike's Rescue Wisdom:**

*"The steeper the cliff, the brighter it shows on our danger map"*

**Danger Level Interpretation:**
- **White areas:** Extreme danger (steep cliffs/strong edges)
- **Gray areas:** Moderate caution (gentle slopes/weak edges)
- **Black areas:** Safe zones (flat ground/no edges)

**Real Example Walkthrough:**
```
Original Scene: A white square on black background
Sam's X-Survey: Detects left and right edges of square
Steve's Y-Survey: Detects top and bottom edges of square
Combined Map: Perfect square outline highlighted
```

**Interactive Moment:** *"Think of the last time you saw a building against the sky. Your brain instantly found the building's edge - that's exactly what we're teaching the computer to do!"*

# 🕵️ TOPIC 3: DETECTIVE CANNY'S MASTER PROTOCOL (20 minutes)

## The Four-Stage Investigation Method (12 minutes)

**Meet Detective Canny - The Master Investigator**

Detective Canny is legendary for his systematic approach. While other detectives get overwhelmed by chaotic crime scenes, Canny follows his proven 4-stage protocol that never fails.

**The Problem with Amateur Detectives:**
- Find "evidence" everywhere (including dust and shadows)
- Miss important clues due to distractions
- Report false evidence that wastes time
- Can't connect related clues together

**Detective Canny's Revolutionary Approach:**
*"Perfect investigation requires systematic elimination of uncertainty"*

### Stage 1: Clean the Crime Scene (2 minutes)

**Canny's Rule:** *"Never investigate a messy scene"*

**What Canny Does:**
- Removes fingerprint powder residue
- Clears distracting debris
- Creates clean environment for investigation

**Computer Translation:**
```python
# Canny's scene cleaning process
clean_scene = cv2.GaussianBlur(crime_scene, (5,5), 0)
```

**Why This Works:**
*"Noise confuses the investigation. Clean first, investigate second."*

### Stage 2: Mark All Potential Evidence (3 minutes)

**Canny's Process:** *"Find EVERY possible clue location"*

**What Canny Does:**
- Systematic sweep of entire scene
- Mark anything that might be evidence
- Don't judge quality yet - just mark locations

**The Sobel Survey Connection:**
Canny uses the same mountain survey technique we learned:
```
Gradient X + Gradient Y = Complete evidence location map
```

**Simple Implementation:**
```python
# Canny's evidence marking (same as mountain survey)
evidence_x = cv2.Sobel(clean_scene, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
evidence_y = cv2.Sobel(clean_scene, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
evidence_strength = np.sqrt(evidence_x**2 + evidence_y**2)
```

### Stage 3: Eliminate False Evidence (4 minutes)

**Canny's Insight:** *"Most potential evidence is actually false evidence"*

**The Problem:**
When you find evidence, nearby areas also look suspicious:
```
Real Evidence: |    (sharp boundary)
False Evidence: ||| (blurry, thick boundary)
```

**Canny's Solution - Non-Maximum Suppression:**
*"In each direction, keep only the strongest evidence"*

**Real-World Analogy:**
Imagine finding footprints in mud:
- **Amateur:** "I see footprint evidence everywhere in this muddy area!"
- **Canny:** "I see ONE clear footprint here - ignore the surrounding mud smears"

**What This Achieves:**
Converts thick, blurry edges into thin, precise lines.

### Stage 4: Connect Related Evidence (3 minutes)

**Canny's Final Step:** *"Strong evidence is reliable, weak evidence needs verification"*

**The Two-Threshold System:**
- **Strong Evidence:** Definitely real (high threshold)
- **Weak Evidence:** Maybe real if connected to strong evidence (low threshold)

**Detective Logic:**
```
Strong Evidence: "This is definitely a clue"
Weak Evidence: "This might be a clue IF it's connected to strong evidence"
Isolated Weak Evidence: "Probably false - ignore it"
```

**Real-World Example:**
- **Strong:** Clear fingerprint on the safe
- **Weak but Connected:** Smudged fingerprint on door handle leading to safe
- **Weak and Isolated:** Random smudge on wall across the room

## The Complete Investigation in Action (8 minutes)

**Detective Canny's Case Study: The Museum Burglary**

**Before Canny's Method:**
```
Amateur Detective Report:
"Evidence everywhere! Thousands of possible clues!
Can't tell what's important. Investigation overwhelmed by false leads."
```

**After Canny's 4-Stage Protocol:**
```
Stage 1: Cleaned scene of distracting elements
Stage 2: Found 847 potential evidence locations
Stage 3: Refined to 23 strong evidence lines
Stage 4: Connected into 8 complete evidence chains

Result: Clear, connected boundaries showing exactly what happened
```

**OpenCV Implementation:**
```python
# Detective Canny's complete investigation protocol
def canny_investigation(crime_scene):
    # Stage 1: Clean the scene
    clean = cv2.GaussianBlur(crime_scene, (5,5), 0)

    # Stages 2-4: Complete investigation
    edges = cv2.Canny(clean, 50, 150)

    return edges  # Clear, connected evidence map
```

**Parameter Meaning:**
- `50`: Weak evidence threshold (*"Maybe a clue if connected"*)
- `150`: Strong evidence threshold (*"Definitely a clue"*)
- Rule of thumb: Low threshold = 0.4 × High threshold

**Visual Result Comparison:**
```
Sobel Method: Thick, fuzzy boundaries (like amateur detective)
Canny Method: Thin, clean, connected lines (like master detective)
```

**Why Canny is Superior:**
1. **Cleaner results:** Removes noise before investigation
2. **Thinner edges:** Precise boundary location
3. **Connected edges:** Links related evidence
4. **Fewer false positives:** Systematic false evidence elimination

**Book Reference:** *Goodfellow's "Deep Learning"* notes: "Canny's systematic approach inspired modern attention mechanisms in deep learning."

# 📚 UNIT TEST 2 PREPARATION (Oct 31)

## What You Must Remember

**The Three Core Analogies:**
1. **Detective Sarah:** Edge detection finds boundaries between regions
2. **Captain Mike:** Gradients measure steepness/change in all directions
3. **Detective Canny:** 4-stage systematic investigation eliminates uncertainty

**Key Technical Points:**
- **Edge definition:** Rapid intensity change between adjacent pixels
- **Gradient:** Rate of change in X and Y directions
- **Sobel filters:** 3×3 weighted masks for gradient calculation
- **Canny stages:** Gaussian blur → Gradient → NMS → Hysteresis

**Exam Strategy:**
Use the analogies to explain concepts, then provide technical details.

**Example Exam Answer:**
*"Edge detection is like Detective Sarah investigating crime scenes - we look for boundaries between different regions. Technically, this means finding rapid intensity changes using gradient calculations..."*

---

# 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS

## Remember These Analogies Forever:

# 🛠️ PART 2: ADVANCED DETECTIVE TECHNIQUES & WORKSHOP (50 minutes)

## 🚁 TOPIC 4: THE HELICOPTER SURVEILLANCE TEAM - Laplacian Edge Detection (12 minutes)

### The Aerial Investigation Approach (5 minutes)

**Meet Captain Rodriguez, Elite Helicopter Surveillance Unit**

While Detective Sarah works on the ground and Captain Mike surveys mountains, Captain Rodriguez provides aerial oversight for complex cases requiring a different perspective.

**The Aerial Advantage:**
*"From the sky, I can see patterns that ground teams miss - but I also see things that aren't really there"*

**Rodriguez's Helicopter Method:**
- **Single pass detection** - spots edges in one flyover
- **360-degree sensitivity** - finds edges in all directions simultaneously
- **High sensitivity** - catches subtle changes others miss
- **Noise prone** - sometimes reports false alarms

### The Laplacian Investigation Protocol (4 minutes)

**How Captain Rodriguez's Team Works:**

**The Second Derivative Concept:**
```
Ground Team (Gradient): "How steep is the slope?"
Helicopter Team (Laplacian): "Where does the slope change from getting steeper to getting flatter?"
```

**Rodriguez's Philosophy:**
*"I look for the peak of the cliff - where it transitions from rising to falling"*

**The Laplacian Insight:**
- **First derivative (gradient):** Finds where intensity changes
- **Second derivative (Laplacian):** Finds where the rate of change changes
- **Edge location:** Where second derivative crosses zero

**Visual Understanding:**
```
Intensity Profile:    Gradient:         Laplacian:
    ___                  ___               ___
   /   \                /   \             /   \
  /     \              /     \           /     \
 /       \            /       \         /       \
-----------          -----------       -----------
                                      Zero crossing = Edge!
```

### Practical Laplacian Implementation (3 minutes)

**Captain Rodriguez's Equipment:**

```python
# Rodriguez's standard helicopter survey filter
laplacian_filter = np.array([
    [0, -1,  0],
    [-1, 4, -1],
    [0, -1,  0]
])

# Advanced helicopter equipment (more sensitive)
advanced_laplacian = np.array([
    [-1, -1, -1],
    [-1,  8, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1]
])
```

**Quick Deployment:**
```python
# Captain Rodriguez's aerial survey
def helicopter_surveillance(image):
    # Standard aerial survey
    laplacian_edges = cv2.Laplacian(image, cv2.CV_64F)

    # Handle negative values (helicopter reports both positive and negative changes)
    laplacian_edges = np.absolute(laplacian_edges)

    return laplacian_edges

# Compare with ground team results
aerial_survey = helicopter_surveillance(image)
```

**When to Call Rodriguez:**
- **Blob detection:** Finding circular or round objects
- **Fine detail work:** Detecting thin lines and small features
- **Quick surveys:** When speed matters more than precision
- **Medical imaging:** Detecting small anomalies

**Rodriguez's Warning:**
*"My helicopter is very sensitive - I pick up noise easily. Always clean the scene first!"*

## 🏔️ TOPIC 5: MULTI-SCALE INVESTIGATION TEAM - Advanced Detection Strategies (13 minutes)

### Chief Inspector Williams' Multi-Altitude Approach (6 minutes)

**Meet Chief Inspector Williams, Head of Special Investigation Unit**

Chief Williams has solved the most complex cases by coordinating investigations at multiple scales - from street-level details to city-wide patterns.

**Williams' Strategic Insight:**
*"Some evidence is only visible from close up, other evidence only appears when you step back and see the big picture"*

**The Multi-Scale Investigation Philosophy:**
```
High Altitude (Low Resolution): See the major boundaries, miss fine details
Medium Altitude (Medium Resolution): Balanced view of structure and detail
Low Altitude (High Resolution): Catch every tiny clue, might miss the big picture
```

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Medical imaging:** Tumor boundaries at different magnifications
- **Satellite imagery:** Roads (large scale) vs buildings (small scale)
- **Manufacturing:** Product outline (large) vs surface defects (small)

### The Pyramid Investigation Protocol (4 minutes)

**Williams' Pyramid Strategy:**

**Step 1: Build the Investigation Pyramid**
```python
def build_investigation_pyramid(image, levels=4):
    """
    Chief Williams' multi-scale investigation setup
    """
    pyramid = [image]  # Original resolution (ground level)

    current = image
    for level in range(1, levels):
        # Move to higher altitude (lower resolution)
        current = cv2.pyrDown(current)
        pyramid.append(current)

    return pyramid
```

**Step 2: Investigate at Each Level**
```python
def multi_scale_edge_investigation(pyramid):
    """
    Coordinate investigations across all altitudes
    """
    edge_pyramid = []

    for level, image in enumerate(pyramid):
        print(f"🔍 Level {level} investigation in progress...")

        # Each level uses appropriate detection sensitivity
        if level == 0:  # Ground level - high sensitivity
            edges = cv2.Canny(image, 30, 90)
        elif level == 1:  # Low altitude - medium sensitivity
            edges = cv2.Canny(image, 50, 150)
        else:  # High altitude - low sensitivity
            edges = cv2.Canny(image, 70, 210)

        edge_pyramid.append(edges)

    return edge_pyramid
```

**Step 3: Combine Intelligence from All Levels**
```python
def combine_multi_scale_evidence(edge_pyramid, original_shape):
    """
    Chief Williams' evidence synthesis protocol
    """
    combined_evidence = np.zeros(original_shape, dtype=np.float64)

    for level, edges in enumerate(edge_pyramid):
        # Bring evidence back to ground level for analysis
        if level > 0:
            # Scale evidence back to original resolution
            for _ in range(level):
                edges = cv2.pyrUp(edges)

            # Crop to original size if needed
            edges = edges[:original_shape[0], :original_shape[1]]

        # Weight evidence based on investigation level
        weight = 1.0 / (level + 1)  # Ground level gets highest weight
        combined_evidence += edges.astype(np.float64) * weight

    return combined_evidence
```

### When to Deploy Multi-Scale Teams (3 minutes)

**Chief Williams' Deployment Guidelines:**

**Use Multi-Scale When:**
- **Complex scenes** with both large and small objects
- **Noisy environments** where single-scale fails
- **Quality control** requiring multiple detail levels
- **Medical analysis** needing comprehensive coverage

**Multi-Scale Success Story:**
```
Case: Factory Quality Control
- High altitude: Detected product outline and major defects
- Medium altitude: Found surface texture irregularities
- Ground level: Caught tiny scratches and micro-defects
Result: Comprehensive quality assessment impossible with single scale
```

**Performance Trade-offs:**
- **Advantages:** More comprehensive detection, robust to noise
- **Disadvantages:** Higher computational cost, more complex processing

        print("  🤔 Class Discussion: Which detective type works best here?")
```

**Student Participation Questions:**
- *"For the noisy crime scene, should we use conservative or aggressive detection?"*
- *"Why does the sensitive detective find too much 'evidence' in some scenes?"*
- *"When would you choose standard vs conservative parameters?"*

#### Workshop Activity 2: Sobel vs Canny Comparison Lab (7 minutes)

**Comparative Investigation Exercise:**

```python
def detective_comparison_lab(student_image):
    """
    Students compare different detective methods on their own images
    """
    print("🔬 DETECTIVE METHOD COMPARISON LAB")

    # Student uploads their own image for analysis

        )
    }

    # Analysis questions for students
    analysis_prompts = [
        "Which method found the clearest object boundaries?",
        "Which method detected the most fine details?",
        "Which method had the most false evidence (noise)?",

```

### Real-World Application Showcase (10 minutes)

#### Application 1: Medical Imaging Detective Work (3 minutes)

**Dr. Sarah Chen, Medical Imaging Specialist**

*"In medical imaging, edge detection literally saves lives by finding tumor boundaries"*

**Medical Edge Detection Challenges:**
- **Low contrast:** Healthy tissue vs abnormal tissue often very similar
- **Noise sensitivity:** Medical equipment introduces artifacts
- **Precision critical:** Missing a boundary could be life-threatening

**Medical Detective Protocol:**
```python
def medical_imaging_protocol(xray_image):
    """
    Dr. Chen's specialized medical edge detection
    """
    # Step 1: Enhance contrast for better visibility
    enhanced = cv2.equalizeHist(xray_image)

    # Step 2: Gentle noise reduction (preserve medical details)
    denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(enhanced, 9, 75, 75)

    # Step 3: Conservative edge detection (avoid false alarms)
    medical_edges = cv2.Canny(denoised, 30, 90)

    # Step 4: Connect broken boundaries (important for diagnosis)
    kernel = np.ones((3,3), np.uint8)
    connected_edges = cv2.morphologyEx(medical_edges, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)

    return connected_edges
```

**Medical Insight:**
*"We use lower thresholds and more connection processing because missing a boundary is worse than having a few false positives"*

#### Application 2: Autonomous Vehicle Vision (4 minutes)

**Engineer Mike Rodriguez, Self-Driving Car Vision Team**

*"Our cars must detect road edges in real-time, in any weather, at 70 mph"*

**Automotive Edge Detection Requirements:**
- **Real-time processing:** 30+ frames per second
- **Weather robust:** Rain, snow, fog, bright sun
- **Safety critical:** Missing a road edge = accident

**Automotive Detective Protocol:**
```python
def automotive_vision_protocol(road_image):
    """
    Real-time road edge detection for autonomous vehicles
    """
    # Step 1: Focus on road region (ignore sky, trees)
    roi = extract_road_region(road_image)

    # Step 2: Fast, robust edge detection
    road_edges = cv2.Canny(roi, 80, 160, apertureSize=3)

    # Step 3: Extract lane lines using Hough transform
    lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(road_edges, 1, np.pi/180,
                           threshold=50, minLineLength=100, maxLineGap=10)

    # Step 4: Real-time validation (are these reasonable lane lines?)
    validated_lines = validate_lane_geometry(lines)

    return validated_lines

def extract_road_region(image):
    """Focus detection on road area only"""
    height, width = image.shape
    # Define road region polygon (bottom 60% of image)
    road_region = np.array([[
        (0, height),
        (0, int(height * 0.4)),
        (width, int(height * 0.4)),
        (width, height)
    ]], dtype=np.int32)

    mask = np.zeros_like(image)
    cv2.fillPoly(mask, road_region, 255)

    return cv2.bitwise_and(image, mask)
```

**Automotive Insight:**
*"We combine edge detection with geometric validation - not every edge is a road edge!"*

#### Application 3: Manufacturing Quality Control (3 minutes)

**Quality Inspector Lisa Park, Electronics Manufacturing**

*"Every smartphone camera lens must be perfect - edge detection finds microscopic defects"*

**Manufacturing Edge Detection Applications:**
- **Defect detection:** Scratches, dents, irregular shapes
- **Precision measurement:** Component dimensions
- **Surface quality:** Texture irregularities

**Quality Control Protocol:**
```python
def quality_control_protocol(product_image):
    """
    High-precision edge detection for quality control
    """
    # Step 1: High-precision edge detection
    precise_edges = cv2.Canny(product_image, 100, 200,
                              apertureSize=5, L2gradient=True)

    # Step 2: Find product contours
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(precise_edges,
                                   cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL,
                                   cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    # Step 3: Quality analysis
    quality_report = analyze_product_quality(contours, product_image.shape)

    return precise_edges, quality_report

def analyze_product_quality(contours, image_shape):
    """Automated quality assessment"""
    defects = []

    for contour in contours:
        area = cv2.contourArea(contour)

        # Flag potential defects
        if area < 10:  # Too small - might be scratch
            defects.append(("Small scratch detected", area))
        elif area > 1000:  # Too large - major defect
            defects.append(("Major defect detected", area))

    return {
        'total_contours': len(contours),
        'potential_defects': len(defects),
        'quality_status': 'PASS' if len(defects) == 0 else 'INSPECT',
        'defect_details': defects
    }
```

**Manufacturing Insight:**
*"In manufacturing, edge detection must be both precise and fast - every product gets inspected"*
