## üé¨ My Demonstration Plan

### Live Demo 1: Image Classification (5 minutes)
**What I'll Show:**
- Pre-trained model classifying common objects
- Upload a photo and watch it predict with confidence scores
- "This is what you'll build by week 8"

**My Script:**
- "Let me show you something cool - this is a neural network trained on millions of images"
- "Watch what happens when I upload this photo of [object]"
- "Notice the confidence scores - the model is telling us how sure it is"
- "In 8 weeks, you'll understand exactly how this works AND build your own"

### Live Demo 2: Object Detection (3 minutes)
**What I'll Show:**
- YOLO detecting multiple objects in real-time
- Draw bounding boxes around different objects
- "This is what you'll master by the end of the course"

**My Script:**
- "Now let's take it up a level - not just 'what' is in the image, but 'where'"
- "This system can identify and locate multiple objects simultaneously"
- "This technology powers autonomous vehicles, security systems, medical imaging"

### Technical Check: Google Colab (2 minutes)
**What I'll Do:**
- Screen share Google Colab interface
- Show how to create new notebook
- Run a simple "Hello World" cell
- "This is where you'll do all your coding"
