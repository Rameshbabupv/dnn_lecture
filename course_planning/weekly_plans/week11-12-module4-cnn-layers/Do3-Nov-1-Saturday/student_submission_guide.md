## Tips for Success

### Time Management

**Assignment 1 (Architecture Experiments):**
- Day 1 (1 hour): Complete experiments 1-4
- Day 2 (1 hour): Work on experiment 5 (custom architecture)
- Day 3 (0.5 hour): Final reflections and submission

**Assignment 2 (Final Challenge):**
- Week 1 (1 hour): Initial architecture and baseline
- Week 1 (1 hour): Add regularization and augmentation
- Week 2 (1 hour): Optimization and tuning
- Week 2 (1 hour): Error analysis and documentation

### Performance Tips

**To achieve 90%+ accuracy:**
1. Use data augmentation (rotation, shift, zoom)
2. Add BatchNormalization after conv layers
3. Use Dropout (0.25 after conv, 0.5 after dense)
4. Try 3-4 conv blocks with increasing filters (32‚Üí64‚Üí128‚Üí256)
5. Use GlobalAveragePooling instead of Flatten
6. Train for enough epochs (20-30 with early stopping)

**To achieve 93%+ accuracy:**
1. All of the above, plus:
2. Learning rate scheduling
3. More aggressive augmentation
4. Deeper network (4-5 conv blocks)
5. Multiple runs with different seeds
6. Ensemble predictions

### Writing Good Reflections

**Bad reflection answer:**
> "I used dropout because it's good for regularization."

**Good reflection answer:**
> "I used dropout with rate 0.25 after conv layers and 0.5 after dense layers because the baseline model showed a 15% gap between training and validation accuracy, indicating overfitting. After adding dropout, the gap reduced to 3%, and validation accuracy improved from 88% to 91%."

**Key differences:**
- ‚úÖ Specific numbers and rates
- ‚úÖ Evidence from experiments
- ‚úÖ Explains reasoning
- ‚úÖ Shows understanding

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Can I use pre-trained models like ResNet?**
A: No, for these assignments you must build from scratch to demonstrate learning. Pre-trained models are for future projects!

**Q: How much code should I write?**
A: Quality over quantity. A well-designed 50-line architecture is better than a messy 200-line one.

**Q: Can I work in groups?**
A: You can discuss concepts, but submit individual work. Your code and reflections must be your own.

**Q: What if I can't achieve the target accuracy?**
A: Submit your best attempt with documentation. Partial credit is available. Show what you tried!

**Q: Can I submit early?**
A: Yes! Early submission is encouraged. You can revise if needed before the deadline.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Should I use CPU or GPU?**
A: GPU is much faster. In Colab: Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU.

**Q: How long should training take?**
A: With GPU: 5-10 minutes. With CPU: 30-60 minutes. Use early stopping to save time.

**Q: What if my Colab keeps disconnecting?**
A: Colab free tier has session limits. Upgrade to Colab Pro, or train locally, or use early stopping.

**Q: Can I use different datasets?**
A: No, these assignments are specifically for Fashion-MNIST to ensure fair comparison.

**Q: How do I know if my accuracy is good enough?**
A: Check the grading rubric. For Assignment 1: >88%. For Assignment 2: >87% (better is encouraged!).

### Grading Questions

**Q: When will grades be posted?**
A: Within 1 week of submission deadline.

**Q: Can I resubmit if I made a mistake?**
A: Before deadline: Yes, resubmit anytime. After deadline: Contact instructor.

**Q: How are reflection answers graded?**
A: Based on thoughtfulness and demonstration of understanding, not length.

**Q: What if my code doesn't run on instructor's machine?**
A: You'll be asked to fix and resubmit with late penalty. Test thoroughly before submitting!
