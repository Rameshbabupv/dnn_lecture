## 🎯 Session Structure (50 minutes)

### Part 1: Problem Setup (10 min)
**Activities:**
- Load CIFAR-10 (50K train, 10K test)
- Explore dataset (10 classes, 32×32 RGB)
- Preprocess: normalize, one-hot encode, validation split

**Student Tasks (TODOs 1.1 - 2.3):**
- Load dataset
- Visualize samples
- Normalize to [0, 1]
- One-hot encode labels
- Create validation split

---

### Part 2: Building Architectures (15 min)

**Baseline Model (Week 10):**
```
Conv2D(32) → MaxPool
Conv2D(64) → MaxPool
Flatten → Dense(128) → Dense(10)

Problems:
- No BatchNorm (slow training)
- No Dropout (overfitting)
- Flatten+Dense (parameter explosion)
```

**Modern Model (Week 11):**
```
Block 1: Conv→BN→ReLU→Conv→BN→ReLU→MaxPool→Dropout(0.2)
Block 2: Conv→BN→ReLU→Conv→BN→ReLU→MaxPool→Dropout(0.3)
Block 3: Conv→BN→ReLU→GlobalAvgPool
Output: Dropout(0.5)→Dense(10)

Improvements:
✅ BatchNorm (faster training, regularization)
✅ Dropout (prevents overfitting)
✅ GlobalAvgPool (parameter reduction)
✅ Double conv per block (deeper features)
```

**Student Tasks (TODOs 3.1 - 4.24):**
- Build baseline architecture
- Build modern architecture with BatchNorm
- Compare parameter counts
- Understand design choices

**Key Teaching Point:**
BatchNorm placement: Conv2D → BatchNormalization() → Activation('relu')
**NOT** Conv2D(activation='relu') → BatchNormalization()

---

### Part 3: Data Augmentation (15 min)

**Augmentation Strategy:**
```python
ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,        # ±15° rotation
    width_shift_range=0.1,    # 10% horizontal shift
    height_shift_range=0.1,   # 10% vertical shift
    horizontal_flip=True,     # Mirror images
    zoom_range=0.1            # 90-110% zoom
)
```

**Student Tasks (TODOs 5.1 - 6.3):**
- Create augmentation pipeline
- Visualize augmented images
- Train baseline (no augmentation)
- Train modern (with augmentation)
- Set up early stopping

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Only augment TRAINING data (not validation/test!)
- CIFAR-10: horizontal flip OK, vertical flip NO
- Rotation ±15° safe (not ±180°)
- Augmentation makes training 2-3× slower but improves generalization

---

### Part 4: Comparison & Analysis (10 min)

**Student Tasks (TODOs 7.1 - 7.4):**
- Evaluate both models on test set
- Plot training curves (accuracy & loss)
- Compare overfitting gaps
- Create confusion matrix
- Answer analysis questions

**Analysis Questions:**
1. Parameter counts comparison (why the difference?)
2. Training speed comparison (why modern slower?)
3. Overfitting analysis (train-val gap)
4. Which technique had biggest impact?
5. What happens if you remove BatchNorm/Dropout/Augmentation?
6. Which classes are most confused?

**Expected Insights:**
- BatchNorm speeds convergence 2-3×
- Dropout reduces overfitting gap from 30% to 3%
- Augmentation improves test accuracy 5-10%
- GlobalAvgPool reduces params 10× with minimal accuracy loss
- Cat-dog, automobile-truck commonly confused
