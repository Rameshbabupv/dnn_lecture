## 🎯 Session Structure (50 minutes)

### Part 1: Problem Setup (10 min)
**Activities:**
- Load CIFAR-10
- Explore dataset (shapes, classes, sample images)
- Preprocess data (normalize, one-hot encode)
- Create validation split

**Key Teaching Points:**
- CIFAR-10 more challenging than MNIST/Fashion-MNIST
- RGB images require more complex features
- Validation split essential for hyperparameter tuning

---

### Part 2: Building Architectures (15 min)

**Baseline Model (Week 10):**
```
Conv2D(32) → MaxPool
Conv2D(64) → MaxPool
Flatten
Dense(128) → Dense(10)

Problems:
- No BatchNorm (slow training)
- No Dropout (overfitting)
- Flatten+Dense (parameter explosion)
```

**Modern Model (Week 11):**
```
Block 1:
Conv2D(32) → BN → ReLU → Conv2D(32) → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout(0.2)

Block 2:
Conv2D(64) → BN → ReLU → Conv2D(64) → BN → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout(0.3)

Block 3:
Conv2D(128) → BN → ReLU → GlobalAvgPool

Output:
Dropout(0.5) → Dense(10)

Improvements:
✅ BatchNorm (faster training, regularization)
✅ Dropout (prevents overfitting)
✅ GlobalAvgPool (parameter reduction)
✅ Double conv per block (deeper features)
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- BatchNorm placement: Conv → BN → Activation (NOT Conv+ReLU → BN)
- Dropout rate progression: 0.2 → 0.3 → 0.5
- GlobalAveragePooling dramatically reduces parameters
- Compare model.summary() for both models

---

### Part 3: Data Augmentation (15 min)

**Augmentation Strategy:**
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,        # ±15° rotation
    width_shift_range=0.1,    # 10% horizontal shift
    height_shift_range=0.1,   # 10% vertical shift
    horizontal_flip=True,     # Mirror images
    zoom_range=0.1            # 90-110% zoom
)
```

**Activities:**
- Create augmentation pipeline
- Visualize augmented images (9 versions of same image)
- Verify augmentations look realistic
- Train with augmentation (train_datagen.flow())

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Only augment TRAINING data (not validation/test!)
- CIFAR-10: horizontal flip OK, vertical flip NO (planes don't fly upside down)
- Rotation ±15° safe (not ±180°)
- Augmentation makes training 2-3× slower but worth it

---

### Part 4: Comparison & Analysis (10 min)

**Training Comparison:**
- Baseline: 30 epochs, no early stopping
- Modern: 30 epochs, early stopping (patience=5)

**Analysis Activities:**
- Plot training curves (accuracy & loss)
- Compare test accuracies
- Analyze overfitting gap (train - val accuracy)
- Create confusion matrix
- Identify most confused classes

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which technique had biggest impact?
2. Why is modern model slower to train?
3. Which classes are hardest to classify?
4. What if we remove BatchNorm? Dropout? Augmentation?
5. How would you improve further?

**Expected Insights:**
- BatchNorm speeds convergence 2-3×
- Dropout reduces overfitting gap from 30% to 5%
- Augmentation improves test accuracy 5-10%
- GlobalAvgPool reduces params 10× with minimal accuracy loss
- Cat-dog, automobile-truck are commonly confused

## 📊 Expected Results

### Baseline Model (No Regularization)
```
Parameters: ~500K
Training time: ~120s/epoch (CPU)
Final results:
  Train accuracy: 92%
  Val accuracy: 63%
  Test accuracy: 62%
  Overfitting gap: 30% (severe!)
```

### Modern Model (Full Regularization)
```
Parameters: ~220K (2.3× fewer!)
Training time: ~180s/epoch (CPU, slower due to augmentation)
Final results:
  Train accuracy: 82%
  Val accuracy: 79%
  Test accuracy: 78%
  Overfitting gap: 3% (excellent!)
```

### Performance Improvement
```
Test accuracy:  +16% (62% → 78%)
Overfitting:    -90% (30% → 3% gap)
Parameters:     -56% (fewer params, better performance!)
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### Technical Lessons
1. **BatchNorm is essential** - Faster training, acts as regularization
2. **Dropout prevents overfitting** - Especially in FC layers
3. **Augmentation improves generalization** - Worth the training time cost
4. **GlobalAvgPool > Flatten** - Fewer parameters, less overfitting
5. **Regularization trades training accuracy for test accuracy** - This is good!

### Design Principles
1. **Start with BatchNorm** - Almost no downside, huge upside
2. **Add augmentation if dataset < 50K** - CIFAR-10 (50K) is borderline
3. **Add dropout if still overfitting** - Progressive rates (0.2 → 0.3 → 0.5)
4. **Use GlobalAvgPool** - Modern standard, parameter efficient
5. **Monitor train-val gap** - Primary overfitting indicator

### Debugging Checklist
- **Model not learning?** → Check BatchNorm placement, learning rate
- **Overfitting?** → Add/increase dropout, add augmentation
- **Underfitting?** → Reduce dropout, increase model capacity
- **Slow training?** → Reduce batch size, use GPU, cache augmentation
- **Poor test accuracy?** → Check augmentation appropriateness, add more data
