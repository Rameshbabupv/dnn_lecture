  - Modules 4-5: Advanced architectures (building on this foundation)

  üéØ CO Achievement Justification

  CO-1 Achievement (40% contribution):

  Why Day 4 is Critical:
  # Students go from theory to implementation
  def sigmoid(x):  # Mathematical understanding
      return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

  class SimpleDenseLayer:  # Network construction
      def forward(self, inputs):
          return activation(inputs @ weights + bias)
  - Mathematical Mastery: Students implement activation functions from formulas
  - System Understanding: Build neural networks from mathematical principles
  - Practical Skills: Create working implementations that match TensorFlow

  CO-2 Achievement (25% contribution):

  Activation Selection Competency:
  network = SimpleNeuralNetwork(
      layer_sizes=[784, 128, 64, 10],
      activations=['relu', 'relu', 'softmax']  # Informed choices
  )
  - Design Decisions: Students learn why ReLU for hidden layers, softmax for output
  - Multi-layer Construction: Understand how layers compose into networks
  - Architecture Principles: Foundation for complex network design
