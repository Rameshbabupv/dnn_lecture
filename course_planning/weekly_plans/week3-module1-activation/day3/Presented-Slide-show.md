---
# Examples 
- Restaurant - everyone eats same food ,  but people pay different amout -> tips => bias 
- Factor : Fine tunning the instruments appling wight 
	- Raw material = x input 
- f -> activation function

### What is Derivatives 

![[Pasted image 20250828163315.png]]

---
# What is Gradient
- It is slope in the diagram 
- more an more, slowly the  voice will come down , neurons will not learn

### Real world Analogies

- Water going through pipe, open , +ve full force 
- Closed - blocked Stoped

# Break 


---
# Recap 
- ReLU -> water flowing on the pipe , closed stped 
- Leaky -> avoid dead neurons - 0.02 make it flow
- Tanh -> Extreme weather -1 to +1 centered at 0
- Sigmoid ->  Variable light , slow changes, but -ve pay the price 
- Swish -> Walking to the automatic door, walkback door still open
- Gelu --> Security clearance , may be may not be caught
