# Week 11 Schedule Adjustment - November 2025

## Actual Schedule (Confirmed by User)

**Week 11 DO3 Sessions:**
- **Friday, October 31, 2025**: 2-hour lecture session
- **Saturday, November 1, 2025**: 2-hour lecture session

**Total Duration**: 4 hours of lecture content across 2 days

## Key Differences from Standard Pattern

### Standard Pattern:
- DO3 (Day Order 3): 2 hours lecture
- DO4 (Day Order 4): 1 hour tutorial
- Total: 3 hours (2hr lecture + 1hr tutorial)

### Week 11 Actual Pattern:
- DO3 Day 1 (Oct 31): 2 hours lecture
- DO3 Day 2 (Nov 1): 2 hours lecture  
- Total: 4 hours lecture (tutorial status unclear)

## Schedule Anomaly Notes

1. **This week is "off"** - User confirmed week structure is unusual
2. **Both days are DO3 lecture sessions** - Not the typical DO3+DO4 pattern
3. **DO4 tutorial status**: Unknown - needs clarification
4. **Reason for change**: Likely related to:
   - Diwali holiday adjustments
   - Unit Test 2 scheduling
   - Academic calendar constraints

## Planning Implications

### Content Distribution Challenge:
- Original plan: 2hr lecture + 1hr tutorial = 3 hours total
- Actual schedule: 2hr + 2hr lectures = 4 hours total
- Need to determine: Expand lecture content OR integrate tutorial into lecture sessions

### Potential Scenarios:

**Scenario A: Pure Lecture (4 hours)**
- Expand theoretical content across both days
- More depth on CNN layers, regularization techniques
- No hands-on tutorial T11

**Scenario B: Lecture + Integrated Tutorial**
- Day 1 (Oct 31): Pure lecture content (2hr)
- Day 2 (Nov 1): Tutorial T11 expanded to 2 hours with theory review

**Scenario C: Hybrid Approach**
- Each day: 1.5hr theory + 0.5hr live coding/demos
- Integrate practical elements throughout

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Unit Test 2**: Was originally scheduled Oct 31 - has this been rescheduled?
2. **Tutorial T11**: Should it happen? If yes, when and for how long?
3. **Content emphasis**: More depth on theory OR maintain practical focus?
4. **Week numbering**: Is this still "Week 11" or has numbering shifted?
