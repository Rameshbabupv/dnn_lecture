# Complete Question Bank Creation Process for Deep Neural Networks Course

## Project Overview
**Course**: 21CSE558T - Deep Neural Network Architectures (M.Tech)
**Assessment**: Formative Test I (Oct 10th) 
**Coverage**: Modules 1-2 (Weeks 1-6)
**Institution**: SRM University

## Phase 1: Initial Request and Requirements Analysis
**User Request**: Create comprehensive question bank for Formative Test I
**Key Requirements**:
- 75 total questions with 1-2-5 mark distribution
- Coverage of Modules 1-2 only
- Based on actual lecture content (Weeks 1-6), not general knowledge
- Follow sample format structure
- Include CO-PO mapping and Bloom's taxonomy alignment

## Phase 2: Critical Error Discovery and Correction
**Major Error Made**: Initially created questions with 2-6-8 mark distribution instead of requested 1-2-5
**User Feedback**: "why did you come up with 8 and 15 additionally, please think hard..."
**Solution**: Completely reworked entire question bank with correct 1-2-5 distribution
**Files Created**: All files with "_Corrected" suffix to maintain quality standards

## Phase 3: Verification Against Actual Lecture Content
**Critical Requirement**: Ensure questions align with delivered lectures, not general knowledge
**Process**:
1. Systematically read actual lecture agendas from weeks 1-6
2. Cross-referenced question content with specific lecture topics
3. Verified mathematical formulations match those taught in class
4. Confirmed terminology and approaches align with course delivery

**Week-by-Week Content Verified**:
- Week 1-2: Perceptron limitations, XOR problem, Boolean logic
- Week 3: Activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU), TensorFlow tensor operations
- Week 4: Gradient descent theory, optimization algorithms, learning rates
- Week 5: Vanishing/exploding gradients, weight initialization, batch normalization
- Week 6: Regularization (L1/L2), overfitting/underfitting, bias-variance tradeoff

## Phase 4: Format Analysis and Requirements Update
**Sample Analysis**: Read FA-1.pdf to understand exact format requirements
**Key Insights Discovered**:
- 2-mark questions must be explanatory/reasoning type, not definition-based
- Expected answers should be flowing paragraphs (40-60 words)
- Questions should ask "Why/What happens/Give reasons"
- Students expected to write cause-effect reasoning, not bullet points

**Memory Updated**: Created detailed format requirements for all future answer keys

## Phase 5: Question Bank Files Created

### Core Question Bank Files:
1. **DNN_Question_Bank_Complete_Corrected.md** - All 75 questions (1-2-5 marks)
2. **Answer_Key_Corrected.md** - Complete solutions with marking schemes
3. **CO_PO_Mapping_Corrected.md** - Updated outcome alignment matrices
4. **Sample_Test_Sets_Corrected.md** - Three sample test papers
5. **README_Corrected.md** - Updated guide with corrected distribution

### Specialized Files:
6. **1-mark-mcq.md** - All 45 MCQ questions extracted separately
7. **1-mark-answers.md** - Comprehensive answer key with detailed explanations
8. **2-mark-questions.md** - All 20 two-mark questions in proper format
9. **2-mark-more-explanation.md** - Extended explanations with analogies

## Phase 6: Answer Key Development Strategy
**Educational Philosophy Established**:
- Explain why correct answer is right AND why each wrong option is wrong
- Include module/week coverage for each question
- Provide deep understanding rather than surface memorization
- Use analogies and real-world examples for complex concepts

**1-Mark Answer Key Features**:
- Module and week mapping for every question
- Technical explanations connecting to specific lectures
- Analysis of why each distractor option is incorrect
- Mathematical reasoning where applicable

## Phase 7: 2-Mark Question Format Transformation
**Challenge**: Initial questions were definition-based, needed scenario-based format
**Solution**: Complete rewrite of all 20 questions following sample analysis

**Transformation Examples**:
- OLD: "What is the difference between loss function and cost function?"
- NEW: "During neural network training, you compute error for individual samples and then average them before updating weights. Explain why this averaging process is necessary..."

**Format Requirements Applied**:
- Scenario-based questions presenting practical situations
- Explanatory answers in paragraph style with cause-effect reasoning
- Technical depth while maintaining accessibility
- Connection to specific week/lecture content

## Phase 8: Extended Learning Materials
**2-Mark More Explanation Document**:
- Comprehensive explanations with real-world analogies
- Mathematical deep dives from actual lectures
- Visual examples and code snippets
- Historical context showing concept evolution
- Common mistakes and best practices

**Educational Approach**:
- Transform abstract concepts into memorable analogies
- Provide multiple learning pathways (visual, mathematical, intuitive)
- Connect concepts across different topics
- Emphasize understanding over memorization

## Key Quality Assurance Measures
1. **Content Verification**: All questions verified against actual Week 1-6 lectures
2. **Format Compliance**: Followed exact sample format requirements
3. **Educational Value**: Focused on deep understanding with explanations
4. **Academic Standards**: Maintained CO-PO mapping and Bloom's taxonomy
5. **Practical Relevance**: Included TensorFlow/Keras implementation details

## Technical Specifications Achieved
- **Total Questions**: 75 (45×1-mark, 20×2-mark, 10×5-mark)
- **Difficulty Distribution**: 37% Easy, 47% Moderate, 16% Difficult
- **CO Coverage**: CO-1 (36.4%), CO-2 (63.6%)
- **Module Coverage**: Module 1 (36.4%), Module 2 (63.6%)
- **Bloom's Levels**: BL1-BL6 appropriately distributed

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices
1. **Always verify mark distribution carefully** before proceeding
2. **Sample analysis is crucial** for understanding exact format requirements
3. **Lecture content verification** ensures academic integrity
4. **Multiple file formats** serve different user needs
5. **Extended explanations** significantly enhance educational value
6. **Analogies and examples** make complex concepts accessible

## Memory Updates Created
1. **answer_key_requirements** - Format standards for all future answer keys
2. **2_mark_question_format_requirements** - Specific format for 2-mark questions
3. **question_bank_creation_process_complete** - This comprehensive record

## Files Delivered
Total of 9 comprehensive files covering all aspects of question bank creation, from basic MCQs to extended learning materials, all verified against actual course content and formatted according to institutional standards.
