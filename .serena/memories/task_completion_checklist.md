# Task Completion Checklist

## When Completing a Task

### 1. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Code follows educational clarity principles
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive and beginner-friendly
- [ ] Complex concepts have accompanying explanations
- [ ] Code aligns with course progression (basic â†’ advanced)

### 2. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run the code to verify it works
- [ ] Check for Python errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify TensorFlow model trains successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] Test with sample inputs (if applicable)

### 3. Environment Checks
- [ ] Correct virtual environment activated
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] No version compatibility issues

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Update relevant documentation if code structure changes
- [ ] Ensure tutorial tasks (T1-T15) remain in sequence
- [ ] Learning objectives clearly stated (if creating tutorials)

### 5. File Management
- [ ] Only created necessary files
- [ ] Preferred editing existing files over creating new ones
- [ ] No unnecessary documentation files created

### 6. Chat History System (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Ask user for current date/time if creating timestamped entries
- [ ] Never use system date/time
- [ ] Document significant Q&A in chat history format
- [ ] Follow chat history templates if applicable

### 7. Commands to Run (when specified by user)
```bash
# Currently no linting/formatting tools configured
# Ask user for specific commands if needed:
# - Linting command?
# - Type checking command?
# - Test command?
# - Format command?
```

## Important Reminders
- NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked
- Always run lint/typecheck if commands are known
- If commands unknown, ask user and suggest saving to CLAUDE.md
- Maintain educational focus over production optimization
- Consider diverse student programming backgrounds
