**Content:**
- **Max Pooling:** Mathematics, when to use, translation invariance
- **Average Pooling:** Smooth feature extraction
- **Global Pooling:** Global Average Pooling (GAP) and Global Max Pooling (GMP)
- **Benefits:** Reduce parameters dramatically, prevent overfitting
- **Stride vs Pooling:** When to use which approach
- **Calculation examples:** 2×2, 3×3 pooling operations
- **Code examples:** Keras implementation

**Key Insight:** GAP eliminates millions of parameters by replacing Flatten + Dense

#### Segment 1.3: Fully Connected Layers in CNNs (15 min)
**Content:**
- Role: Feature combination → Classification
- Parameter explosion problem (7×7×512 → 1000 = 25M parameters!)
- When to use Dense layers vs Global Pooling
- Modern trend: Minimize FC layers
- **Architecture comparison:**
  - Traditional: Conv → Pool → Flatten → Dense(1024) → Dense(10)
  - Modern: Conv → Pool → GlobalAvgPool → Dense(10)

#### Segment 1.4: Stacking Layers - Architecture Patterns (15 min)
**Content:**

### Hour 2: CNN Regularization & Optimization (60 minutes)

#### Segment 2.1: Dropout in CNNs (15 min)
**Content:**
- Why CNNs overfit (especially in FC layers)
- Dropout mechanism: Random neuron deactivation
- **Placement strategy:**
  - ✅ After FC layers (always)
  - ⚠️ After Conv layers (sometimes)
  - ❌ Before output layer (never)
- Dropout rate selection: 0.2, 0.3, 0.5
- Training vs inference behavior
- Code example with Keras Dropout layer

**Key Insight:** Dropout most effective in FC layers where overfitting is worst

#### Segment 2.2: Batch Normalization (20 min)
**Content:**
- **Problem:** Internal covariate shift slows learning
- **Solution:** Normalize layer inputs: (x - μ) / σ, then scale/shift with learnable γ, β
- **Placement:** After Conv, before activation (Conv → BN → ReLU)
- **Benefits:**
  - Faster training (enables higher learning rates)
  - Acts as regularization
  - Less sensitive to weight initialization
  - Can reduce/eliminate dropout need
- **Architecture comparison:**
  - Without BN: Conv2D → ReLU → Pool
  - With BN: Conv2D → BatchNormalization → ReLU → Pool
- Code example with Keras BatchNormalization

#### Segment 2.3: Data Augmentation (20 min)
**Content:**
- **Problem:** Limited training data leads to overfitting
- **Solution:** Artificially increase dataset diversity

**Augmentation Techniques:**
1. **Geometric transformations:**
   - Rotation (±15°, ±30°)
   - Horizontal/vertical flip
   - Zoom (0.8-1.2x)
   - Translation (shift ±10%)

2. **Photometric transformations:**
   - Brightness adjustment
   - Contrast changes
   - Color jittering

3. **Advanced techniques:**
   - Random crop
   - Cutout/Random erasing
   - Mixup (blend images)

**When augmentation helps:**
- Small datasets (<10K images)
- Class imbalance problems
- Real-world variations expected

**When to be careful:**
- Medical imaging (don't flip X-rays!)
- Text/digit recognition (don't rotate 180°)
- Domain-specific constraints

**Code demo:** Keras ImageDataGenerator with rotation, shift, flip, zoom

#### Segment 2.4: L1/L2 Regularization in CNNs (5 min)
- Brief review from Module 2
- Applying kernel_regularizer to Conv layers
- Less common than Dropout/BatchNorm in modern CNNs
- Use case: Very small datasets

#### Segment 2.5: Putting It All Together (10 min)
**Modern CNN Architecture Template:**
```
Input (224×224×3)
↓
[Conv(32) → BN → ReLU → Conv(32) → BN → ReLU → MaxPool] 
↓
[Conv(64) → BN → ReLU → Conv(64) → BN → ReLU → MaxPool]
↓
[Conv(128) → BN → ReLU → Conv(128) → BN → ReLU → MaxPool]
↓
GlobalAvgPool
↓
Dropout(0.5)
↓
Dense(num_classes, softmax)
```

**Regularization Checklist:**
- ✅ Data augmentation (if data < 50K)
- ✅ Batch normalization (almost always)
- ✅ Dropout in FC layers (0.3-0.5)
- ✅ Early stopping (monitor val_loss)
- ⚠️ L2 regularization (if needed)

**Preview:** Tutorial T11 tomorrow - implementing all techniques

## DO4 (1 Hour) - TUTORIAL T11 PLAN

### Tutorial T11: Multiclass Classification with Data Augmentation

### Session Structure (50 minutes)

#### Part 1: Problem Setup (10 min)

**Dataset: CIFAR-10** (60K images, 10 classes, 32×32 RGB)
- Classes: airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
- More challenging than Fashion-MNIST
- Realistic RGB images

**Activities:**
- Load CIFAR-10 dataset
- Explore shapes and classes (50K train, 10K test)
- Visualize sample images from each class
- Preprocess: Normalize to [0,1]
- Create train/validation split

#### Part 2: Building Improved CNN Architecture (15 min)

**Goal:** Build on Week 10's simple CNN with modern regularization

**Baseline Architecture (Week 10 style):**
```python
Conv2D(32) → MaxPool → Conv2D(64) → MaxPool → Flatten → Dense(64) → Dense(10)
```

**Improved Architecture (Week 11 with regularization):**
```python
# Block 1
Conv2D(32) → BatchNorm → ReLU → Conv2D(32) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout(0.2)

# Block 2  
Conv2D(64) → BatchNorm → ReLU → Conv2D(64) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool → Dropout(0.3)

# Block 3
Conv2D(128) → BatchNorm → ReLU → GlobalAvgPool

# Classification
Dropout(0.5) → Dense(10, softmax)
```

**Key Teaching Points:**
- BatchNorm placement (after Conv, before activation)
- Dropout rate progression (0.2 → 0.3 → 0.5)
- GlobalAveragePooling vs Flatten+Dense
- Dramatic parameter reduction
- Model summary analysis

#### Part 3: Data Augmentation Implementation (15 min)

**Activities:**
1. Create ImageDataGenerator with augmentation:
   - Rotation: ±15°
   - Width/height shift: 10%
   - Horizontal flip
   - Zoom: 10%

2. **Visualize augmented images:**
   - Show 9 augmented versions of same image
   - Verify augmentations look realistic
   - Check labels preserved correctly

3. **Training with augmentation:**
   - Use datagen.flow() for training
   - No augmentation for validation data
   - Add early stopping callback
   - Train for 50 epochs

**Code Structure:**
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    zoom_range=0.1
)

history = model.fit(
    train_datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32),
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    epochs=50,
    callbacks=[early_stopping]
)
```

#### Part 4: Comparison & Analysis (10 min)

**Comparison Activities:**
1. Train baseline model (no regularization)
2. Train improved model (with regularization)
3. Compare test accuracies
4. Plot training curves (accuracy & loss)
5. Identify overfitting reduction

**Analysis:**
- Plot accuracy: Training vs Validation
- Plot loss: Look for overfitting gap
- **Key observation:** Regularization reduces train-val gap
- Create confusion matrix
- Identify most confused classes

**Discussion Questions:**
- Which augmentations helped most?
- Did BatchNorm speed up training?
- Which classes are hardest to classify?
- What's the train-test accuracy gap?

**Expected Results:**
- Baseline: ~60-65% test accuracy, significant overfitting
- Improved: ~70-80% test accuracy, reduced overfitting

## Common Student Pitfalls & Solutions

### Expected Questions/Challenges:

1. **"BatchNorm before or after activation?"**
   - **Standard:** Conv → BN → ReLU
   - Modern research shows both work, but this is convention
   - Explain both approaches exist

2. **"Should I use ALL regularization techniques?"**
   - Start with BatchNorm + Data Augmentation
   - Add Dropout only if still overfitting
   - Don't over-regularize → underfitting
   - Monitor train-val gap

3. **"Augmentation makes training slower"**
   - Yes, 2-3x slower due to on-the-fly transformations
   - Better generalization worth the time cost
   - Can reduce total epochs needed
   - Consider using cached augmentation for speedup

4. **"Model not learning with too much dropout"**
   - Start with 0.2-0.3, increase incrementally
   - High dropout (>0.5) should be rare
   - Check if underfitting (both train and val acc low)

5. **"GlobalAveragePooling gives worse accuracy than Flatten+Dense"**
   - GAP needs more filters before it (increase to 256-512)
   - May need deeper network
   - Trade-off: fewer parameters vs slight accuracy drop
   - Modern architectures prefer GAP for generalization

6. **"Which augmentations should I use?"**
   - Start with flip + rotation + shift
   - Test each augmentation individually
   - Avoid unrealistic transformations (180° rotation for faces)
   - Domain knowledge is critical

## Pedagogical Strategy

### Teaching Approach:
1. **Build on Week 10:** Reference simple CNN, show limitations
2. **Problem-Solution pattern:** Overfitting → Regularization
3. **Visual-first:** Show augmented images, architecture diagrams, training curves
4. **Compare always:** Baseline vs Improved side-by-side
5. **Hands-on emphasis:** Live coding, encourage experimentation

### Key Message Progression:
- **Week 10:** "Build your first CNN" (mechanics)
- **Week 11:** "Make it BETTER" (regularization) ← CURRENT
- **Week 12:** "Use pre-trained models" (transfer learning)

### Reality Checks:
- Show real overfitting curves
- Demonstrate augmentation preventing overfitting
- Compare parameter counts (millions → thousands)
- Connect to real-world applications
