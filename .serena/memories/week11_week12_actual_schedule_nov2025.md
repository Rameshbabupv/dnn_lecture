## Notes

1. **Week 11 is now 4 lecture hours + 1 tutorial** (Oct 31, Nov 1, Nov 3)
2. **FT2 likely Nov 14** during DO3 2-hour slot
3. **Week 12 compressed** due to FT2 in Week 13
4. **Module 4 coverage accelerated** to complete before FT2
5. **Transfer Learning must be covered** before Nov 14 if included in FT2

---

## Questions to Clarify

1. Should Nov 1 (Saturday) cover Transfer Learning or stay with Week 11 topics?
2. Will Transfer Learning be included in FT2 (Nov 14)?
3. Week 12 schedule (Nov 4-9) - what sessions are available?
4. Should we dedicate Nov 13 (if available) as FT2 review session?
