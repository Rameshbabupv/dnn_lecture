# Week 8 Day 4 - Holiday-Adjusted Schedule (Oct 9, 2025)

## Important Context
**Due to holidays, we missed Week 8 sessions. The schedule has shifted:**
- **Calendar Date**: Wednesday, October 9, 2025
- **Actual Course Week**: Week 8, Day Order 4 (not Week 9)
- **Folder Location**: `do4-oct-09` is CORRECT for Week 8, Day 4
- **Session Duration**: 1 HOUR (Day Order 4 = Tutorial session)

## Schedule Adjustment Due to Holidays
- Week 8 sessions were delayed due to holidays
- We are currently in **Week 8, Day Order 4** (Oct 9)
- This maintains the day order numbering (do4) while accounting for calendar shift

## Class Duration Rules
- **Day Order 3 (do3)**: 2 hours - Lecture sessions
- **Day Order 4 (do4)**: 1 hour - Tutorial/Practical sessions ← TODAY

## What Should Be Covered: Week 8, Day 4 (Oct 9) - 1 HOUR TUTORIAL

### **Tutorial Focus: ROI & Morphological Operations in OpenCV**

Since we only have 1 hour, this should be a hands-on practical session covering:

#### **Part 1: ROI Extraction (25 minutes)**
- ROI selection using bounding boxes
- Contour-based ROI extraction
- Quick demo: Extract objects from image
- Student exercise: Extract ROI from sample images

#### **Part 2: Morphological Operations (25 minutes)**
- Erosion and dilation basics
- Opening/closing for noise removal
- Quick demo: Clean noisy binary image
- Student exercise: Apply morphological ops to documents

#### **Part 3: Integration Exercise (10 minutes)**
- Mini-project: Segment → ROI → Morphological cleaning
- Students submit working code
- Q&A and troubleshooting

## Learning Objectives for Oct 9 (1 hour)
1. Implement ROI extraction in OpenCV
2. Apply basic morphological operations
3. Build simple image processing pipeline
4. Prepare for Tutorial T8 continuation

## Deliverables
- Working ROI extraction code
- Morphological operations implementation
- Combined pipeline example

## Context from Previous Session
- **Day Order 3 (Oct 8)**: 2-hour comprehensive lecture on image segmentation
- **Day Order 4 (Oct 9)**: 1-hour hands-on tutorial to practice the concepts ← CURRENT

## Next Sessions
- Continue with Week 8/9 adjusted schedule
- Tutorial T8 (Image Segmentation with OpenCV) - may span multiple sessions
- Feature extraction topics following
- Mid-term Practical preparation

## Key Note
The folder `do4-oct-09` correctly represents Day Order 4 (1-hour tutorial) on October 9, accounting for the holiday-adjusted schedule.
