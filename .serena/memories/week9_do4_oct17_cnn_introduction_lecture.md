## Critical Analogies to Emphasize

1. **Watchmaker (Industrial Revolution)** - Manual features ‚Üí Automatic learning
2. **Lego Building** - Hierarchical construction from simple to complex
3. **Postal Detective (Stamp & Ink Pad)** - Convolution operation ‚≠ê CENTRAL ANALOGY
4. **Security Camera Grid** - Multiple filters detecting different patterns
5. **Trophy Cabinet** - Max pooling (keep best wins)
6. **Factory Assembly Line** - Complete CNN pipeline
7. **Art Student Evolution** - Progressive skill building through layers

## Teaching Philosophy Applied

### 70-20-10 Rule Followed
- **70% Analogies:** Every concept introduced through story
- **20% Visuals:** ASCII diagrams, comparison tables, heat maps
- **10% Code:** Only 3 snippets total, each 5-10 lines

### Concept Before Code
- Students understand "WHY" before "HOW"
- Visual/intuitive understanding first
- Mathematical details in supplementary notes
- Code serves to illustrate, not overwhelm

### Memory Anchors
- Named characters (Detective Maria, Giovanni, Dr. Sarah)
- Consistent terminology throughout
- Bridges to Week 9 manual features
- Forward bridges to Week 10 CNN details

## Assessment Integration

### Unit Test 2 (Oct 31) - Expected Questions
**MCQs:**
- Limitations of manual feature extraction
- Biological inspiration of CNNs
- Convolution operation concept
- Pooling purpose and types
- CNN vs traditional ML comparison

**5-Mark Questions:**
- Explain CNN hierarchy with example
- Describe convolution operation with diagram
- Compare manual features vs learned features
- Explain biological inspiration of CNNs

**10-Mark Questions:**
- Design CNN architecture for given problem
- Trace feature learning through CNN layers
- Compare traditional ML and CNN pipelines with example

### Homework Assignment
**Due:** Before Week 10 lecture

1. **Compare & Contrast:** Take T9 example, list manual features, imagine CNN-learned features (5-7 sentences)
2. **Visual Exploration:** Google CNN visualizations layer 1 vs layer 5, analyze patterns
3. **Conceptual Question:** "Why learn manual features if CNNs are better?" (3-4 sentences)

## Instructor Preparation Checklist

### Live Demo Materials
- [ ] Edge detection filter visualization
- [ ] Pre-trained CNN feature maps (Layer 1, 3, 5)
- [ ] ImageNet example ready
- [ ] Simple Keras CNN code visible (no execution)

### Common Student Questions (Prepared Answers)
1. *"Why learn manual features at all?"*
   ‚Üí Small data, explainability, understanding foundations, computational constraints
2. *"How many layers should a CNN have?"*
   ‚Üí Depends on problem complexity (typical: 5-50 layers)
3. *"Can I use CNN for non-image data?"*
   ‚Üí Yes! Time series, audio, even text (with modifications)
4. *"Do I need GPU?"*
   ‚Üí For training large CNNs, yes. For learning/small examples, no.

## Key Success Metrics

Students should leave thinking:
- ‚úÖ "I understand WHY CNNs exist" (Manual features have limitations)
- ‚úÖ "I can explain convolution using Detective Maria analogy"
- ‚úÖ "I see the connection from Week 9 to Module 4"
- ‚úÖ "I'm excited to learn more next week"

NOT thinking:
- ‚ùå "That was too technical"
- ‚ùå "I'm overwhelmed by math"
- ‚ùå "How does this relate to what we learned Wednesday?"

## Important Design Decisions

### Modular Documentation Approach
- **Main lecture notes:** Clean, focused, delivery-ready
- **Additional notes:** Deep-dive supplementary material
- **Reason:** Flexibility for instructor, options for students
- **Benefit:** Main lecture stays on time, interested students get more depth

### Analogy-First Philosophy
- Every technical concept introduced through relatable story
- Stories maintained throughout explanation (not abandoned)
- Code comes last, illustrates story
- Goal: Students remember concepts through stories during exams

### Bridge, Don't Deep-Dive
- This is INTRODUCTION to Module 4, not full technical treatment
- Focus on intuition and motivation
- Save mathematical rigor for Week 10
- Build excitement and understanding today, technical skills next week
