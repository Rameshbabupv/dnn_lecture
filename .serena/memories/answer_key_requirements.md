# Answer Key Creation Requirements

## Key Requirements for All Answer Keys

### Structure Requirements:
1. **File naming**: Use pattern like `1-mark-answers.md`, `2-mark-answers.md`, etc.
2. **Module and Week Coverage**: Specify exactly which module and week each question is covered
3. **Comprehensive Explanations**: Not just correct answers, but educational explanations

### Content Requirements for Each Question:
1. **Correct Answer Explanation**: Detailed explanation of why the correct option is right
2. **Wrong Options Analysis**: Detailed explanation of why EACH wrong option is incorrect
3. **Learning Context**: Connect to specific lecture content, tutorials, or practical examples
4. **Educational Value**: Help students understand concepts deeply, not just memorize

### Educational Philosophy:
- Students should learn WHY options are wrong, not just which one is right
- Connect answers to specific course content (modules, weeks, tutorials)
- Provide context from actual lectures delivered
- Use terminology and mathematical formulations exactly as taught in class

### Quality Standards:
- Explanations should be detailed enough for self-study
- Reference specific week/day content when possible
- Include mathematical reasoning where applicable
- Use examples from tutorials (T1-T6) when relevant

This approach ensures students gain deep understanding rather than superficial knowledge.
