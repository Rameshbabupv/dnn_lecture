## Key Features of Version 2

### 1. Teaching Philosophy (80-15-5 Rule)

### 2. Character Naming Convention (ENFORCED)
All teaching characters use:
- **"Character:" prefix** (e.g., "Character: Dr. Priya")
- **Indian names** (Dr. Priya, Arjun, Meera, Dr. Rajesh, Detective Kavya)
- **Clear distinction** from real scientists (e.g., "**Hubel and Wiesel (1959)**")

### 3. Accurate Week 9 References
**Features actually taught in Week 9:**
- ✅ Shape: Area, circularity, Hu moments, aspect ratio
- ✅ Color: Histograms, color moments, dominant colors
- ✅ Texture: **LBP (Local Binary Patterns)**, **GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**, edge density

**NOT taught (removed from references):**
- ❌ SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- ❌ HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
- ❌ Gabor filters

## Key Pedagogical Decisions

### 1. Concept Before Calculation
Every mathematical operation is explained in plain language BEFORE any numbers:
- "What IS Convolution? (In Plain Words)" - 7 parts
- Coffee filter analogy
- ECG pattern matching story
- Only THEN show the calculation

### 2. ONE Strategic Calculation Per Concept
**Version 1 approach (rejected):**
```
Concept → Calc 1 → Calc 2 → Calc 3 → Calc 4 → Code
Problem: Students drown in arithmetic
```

**Version 2 approach (current):**
```
Rich Story → Visual → ONE Calculation → "That's it!" → Trust Library
Benefit: Intuition FIRST, mechanics ONCE, move to applications
```

### 3. Character Story Integration
- **Dr. Priya:** Cardiologist (1D convolution, ECG analysis)
- **Arjun:** Photographer (2D convolution, edge detection)
- **Meera:** Quality control engineer (kernel size trade-offs)
- **Dr. Rajesh:** Radiologist (stride, 3D convolution, medical imaging)
- **Detective Kavya:** Security analysis (pooling, multiple filters, Week 9 callback)

### 4. Visual-First Approach
- ASCII art diagrams throughout
- Sliding window animations (textual)
- Feature map visualizations
- Architecture flowcharts

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Character Naming (Oct 2025)
**Issue:** Plain names (Sarah, Giovanni) confused with real scientists
**Solution:** 
- All characters prefixed with "Character:"
- Changed to Indian names (cultural relevance)
- Created memory rule document

### Fix 2: Magnitude Clarification (Oct 2025)
**Issue:** Convolution output values higher than "perfect match" seemed contradictory
**Solution:** Added explanations in TWO places:
- Early warning after similarity concept
- Detailed breakdown after showing full output
- Key insight: Convolution = pattern similarity × signal magnitude

### Fix 3: Accurate Week 9 References (Oct 2025)
**Issue:** Referenced SIFT and HOG which were NOT taught in Week 9
**Solution:** Updated all references to reflect actual Week 9 content:
- LBP (Local Binary Patterns)
- GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix)
- Shape features (area, circularity, Hu moments)
- Color features (histograms, moments)
