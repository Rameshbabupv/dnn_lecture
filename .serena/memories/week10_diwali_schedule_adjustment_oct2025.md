## Session Details

### DO3 - October 27, 2025 (Saturday)
- **Topic:** CNN Mathematical Foundations and Architecture Components
- **Duration:** 2 hours (8:00 AM - 9:40 AM IST)
- **Content:**
  - Hour 1: Convolution mathematics (1D/2D, parameters)
  - Hour 2: CNN architecture (pooling, complete pipeline, 3D preview)
- **Materials Status:** ✅ Complete (comprehensive_lecture_notes_v2.md)

### DO4 - October 29, 2025 (Monday)
- **Topic:** Tutorial T10 - Building CNN in Keras
- **Duration:** 1 hour (4:00 PM - 4:50 PM IST)
- **Content:**
  - Fashion-MNIST dataset
  - First CNN implementation
  - Training and evaluation
  - Filter visualization
- **Materials Status:** ⏳ Pending (to be created)

## Timeline Impact

**Days between sessions:**
- DO3 to DO4: 2 days (Saturday → Monday)
- DO4 to Unit Test 2: 2 days (Monday Oct 29 → Friday Oct 31)

**Student preparation time:**
- Reduced preparation time due to compressed schedule
- Students need to complete homework (3 tasks) in 2 days instead of typical week
- May need to adjust homework deadline

## Assessment Considerations

**Unit Test 2 (Oct 31):**
- Still covers Modules 3-4 as planned
- Week 10 content included in test
- Students have only 2 days after DO4 tutorial to review
- Recommend: lighter homework load OR extended deadline

## Recommendations

**For Instructor:**
1. Prepare comprehensive materials for Saturday session (students may be rusty after 1-week break)
2. Consider brief Week 9 recap at start of DO3
3. Provide extra office hours between Oct 29-31 for exam prep
4. Share lecture recordings if available (holiday learning loss)

**For Students:**
1. Review Week 9 materials before Oct 27 (feature extraction, CNN intro)
2. Complete Tutorial T10 on Oct 29 (hands-on practice critical for exam)
3. Start Unit Test 2 preparation immediately after DO4
4. Focus on: convolution calculations, output dimensions, architecture design

- Typically 5-day celebration period
- Universities/institutions observe holidays
- Students and faculty travel for family celebrations
- Educational institutions resume with adjusted schedules

## Next Actions

**Immediate (Before Oct 27):**
- [ ] Create Tutorial T10 materials (starter code, solution, notes)
- [ ] Review and test comprehensive_lecture_notes_v2.md
- [ ] Prepare handouts for Saturday session
- [ ] Notify students of schedule change (if not already done)

**Post-Diwali (Oct 29 onwards):**
- [ ] Deliver Tutorial T10 session
- [ ] Assess student preparedness after holiday break
- [ ] Provide Unit Test 2 review materials
- [ ] Plan Week 11 (Famous CNN architectures)
