  - Loss divergence patterns in learning curves
  - Model sensitivity to data changes
  - Hands-on visualization with polynomial fitting example

- **Practical Implementation** (15 minutes)
  - Live coding demonstration with matplotlib
  - Three-model comparison: underfitting, good fit, overfitting
  - Interactive Q&A and concept reinforcement

### Hour 2: Classical Regularization Techniques (60 minutes)

**L1 Regularization (LASSO)** (25 minutes)
- Mathematical foundation: L_total = L_original + λ∑|w_i|
- Geometric interpretation: Diamond-shaped constraint
- Feature selection capability ("Marie Kondo approach")
- TensorFlow implementation with sparsity analysis
- Weight distribution visualization

**L2 Regularization (Ridge)** (25 minutes)
- Mathematical foundation: L_total = L_original + λ∑w_i²
- Geometric interpretation: Circular constraint
- Weight smoothing behavior ("Equal opportunity employer")
- Comparative analysis with L1
- Direct implementation comparison

**Hyperparameter Selection** (10 minutes)
- Lambda (λ) selection strategies
- Cross-validation techniques
- Typical value ranges: L1 (0.001-0.1), L2 (0.001-0.01)
- Learning rate interaction considerations
