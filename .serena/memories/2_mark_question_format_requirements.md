# 2-Mark Question Format Requirements (Updated from Sample Analysis)

## Key Insights from Sample FA-1.pdf Analysis:

### Question Format Requirements:
1. **Question Style**: Explanatory/reasoning questions that ask "Why", "What happens when", "Give reasons", "Explain the concept"
2. **NOT Definition-based**: Avoid simple "Define X" questions
3. **Problem-Solving Context**: Often embedded in scenarios or practical situations

### Expected Answer Format:
1. **Paragraph Style**: Complete sentences in flowing paragraph format
2. **Length**: 40-60 words (2-4 sentences)
3. **Structure**: Problem → Explanation → Consequence/Impact
4. **Technical Reasoning**: Must include cause-effect relationships
5. **NO Bullet Points**: Continuous prose, not fragmented points

### Sample Questions from FA-1.pdf:
- "What happens if your learning rate is too high?"
- "You observe that during training of an MLP on the XOR dataset, the loss curve oscillates violently and never converges. Give reasons."
- "Why is a non-linear activation function essential in hidden layers of an ANN?"

### Sample Answer Style:
```
"Instead of moving steadily toward the minimum of the loss function, the parameter updates 'overshoot' it. This can cause the model to diverge, with the loss increasing rather than decreasing."
```

### Marking Approach:
- **2 marks total** - likely 1 mark per key concept/reasoning point
- Focus on **understanding** rather than memorization
- Reward **technical explanation** and **logical flow**

### Time Allocation:
- **3-4 minutes** per 2-mark question
- Students need time to **think and write explanatory text**

### Updated Question Creation Guidelines:
1. Frame questions around **problem scenarios**
2. Ask for **explanations** rather than definitions
3. Include **cause-effect reasoning** requirements
4. Expect **paragraph responses** with complete sentences
5. Test **understanding** of underlying principles
6. Connect to **practical situations** students might encounter

This format ensures students demonstrate deep understanding through explanatory reasoning rather than rote memorization.
