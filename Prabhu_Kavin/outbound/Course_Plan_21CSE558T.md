## 10.0 Overall Execution Plan

| # | Activity | Execution |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Attainment Level - Setting up of target | The target is 2.5 for all Course Outcomes |
| 2 | Lecture handling – Theory | The lecture will be handled through PPT/Jupyter Notebooks/Interactive Coding Sessions |
| 3 | Tutorial handling | Google Colab, TensorFlow/Keras environment, OpenCV demonstrations |
| 4 | Question Paper Scrutiny | The FT questions are to be taken with respect to Bloom's Taxonomy based on Course Learning Assessment (CLA), Performance Indicators (PIs), COs and POs. The same will be validated and verified by audit professor. |
| 5 | Conduct of Test | FT-1 (5 marks)<br>FT-II (15 marks)<br>FT-III (15 marks)<br>FT-IV (15 marks)<br>LLT-1 (10 marks) |
| 6 | Mark Entry | The marks will be entered in academia after the FT components evaluation |
| 7 | Course File Preparation | The course file will be prepared simultaneously from the very first phase of commencement of course based on the SOC & Dept. checklist |
| 8 | COPO mapping | The COPO mapping will be done for every CLA Component and for the end semester result as well. |
| 9 | Co Teaching | Co Teaching has to be organized for students and the same will be tested based on Technical Papers/Projects and HOTS which will be considered for LLT Component. |
| 10 | Presentation on real world applications | Presentation on their technical paper/project will be conducted for course students to showcase their skills in deep learning applications |
| 11 | Conduct of meeting with Course Audit Professor | Before and after the commencement of every test meeting will be conducted with audit professor to discuss the progress of course |
| 12 | Feedback collection | The feedback will be collected from students (mid sem and end sem) |
| 13 | Technical Environment Setup | Ensure all students have access to Google Colab, TensorFlow 2.x, Keras, OpenCV, and necessary Python libraries |
| 14 | Industry Integration | Guest lectures from industry experts, case studies from real-world applications, internship opportunities discussion |
| 15 | Research Integration | Encourage students to explore latest research papers, implement state-of-the-art models, contribute to open-source projects |
