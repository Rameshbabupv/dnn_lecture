### üìö Suggested Tools & Platforms

* **Google Colab** (for coding labs)
* **TensorFlow 2.x + Keras API**
* **Visual Aids:** Use diagrams (e.g., biological neuron vs perceptron, FFNN)
* **Optional Tools:** TensorBoard for visualizing computation graph

### üìå Tips for Delivery

* Start with a neuron visual analogy (brain cell to Python object)
* Use [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) to demo XOR solution visually
* Keep first session interactive with logical gate challenges
* Use whiteboard/pen tab for visualizing backpropagation
